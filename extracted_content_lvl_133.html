<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Dr Wuille explained at <b>Wuille1 [50]
                {C1/1/2</b>}, Bitcoin Core is the current name of the most commonly used fully-validating node software
              implementation. The name was introduced in March 2014 in version 0.9 of the software as follows
              <b>{L8/467/2}</b>:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>To reduce confusion between
                    Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software we have renamed the reference client to Bitcoin

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When considering what Dr Wright said when this
              anachronism was put to him, one needs to keep in mind that Dr Wright seems to use the term ‘BTC Core’ as a
              catch-all to refer to the Developers. In the BTC Core claim, he and his companies sued ‘BTC Core’ as the
              first defendant, but there has never been any evidence that such an entity exists, other than, perhaps, in
              Dr Wright’s mind because <b>Wright11</b> is full of his complaints about what has been done or not done by
              ‘BTC Core’.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s response was to suggest that:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The terminology of Bitcoin Core (capital B,
                  capital C) had been used “<i>multiple times</i>” prior to March 2014 <b>{Day8/134:24}</b>, but there
                  is nothing to support that contention. As Dr Wuille explained in his unchallenged evidence, the name
                  was suggested by Gavin Andresen and was not used before version 0.9 of the software.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">‘You adopted that name’ i.e. that
                  “<i>Bitcoin Core</i>” (i.e. the first defendant) had adopted the name Bitcoin Core from something
                  else/someone else <b>{Day8/135:3-4}</b>, but this was an irrelevant diversion. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The term “Bitcoin Core” was being used in
                  the SEIR_C document in contradistinction to Simplified Payment Verification (or SPV)
                  <b>{Day8/135:7-8}</b>. Even if that were the case, and that does not seem to be so from just reading
                  the document (the document had been edited to say that SPV had not been modelled at that time – see
                  footnote4 at <b>{L3/237/7}</b>), it still would not explain the anachronism.</p>
