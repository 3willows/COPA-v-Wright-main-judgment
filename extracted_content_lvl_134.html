<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bitcoin only allows nodes to accept a block if
              all transactions in it are valid and are not already spent {see the Bitcoin White Paper at [5.5]
              <b>{L5/26/3}</b>}. The initial release of the Bitcoin Software required there to be an index of historical
              transactions to enable nodes to check whether the output of a transaction had already been spent
              {<b>Wuille1 [30] {C1/1/7}</b>}. That index was called blkindex.dat <b>{L8/12/1}</b> and included
              information about all transactions that had occurred so far, including fully spent transactions, as well
              as transactions with unspent outputs. The index would point the software to the relevant block data from
              which the full raw transaction data could be obtained.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As a result of a patch authored by Dr Wuille,
              and placed by him on GitHub by pull request 1677 in August 2012, a significant optimisation was proposed
              to that approach. Because a spent transaction cannot be spent again, there was no need for nodes to check
              new transactions against spent transactions. It was sufficient that nodes confirm that any new
              transactions were of an unspent output from another transaction. As part of Dr Wuille’s pull request he
              proposed replacing the transaction index with a database containing just the <u>unspent</u> transaction
              outputs {<b>Wuille1 [30-31] {C1/1/7}</b>}.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_754"><span class="judgment-body__number">754.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The change proposed by Dr Wuille was introduced
              in version 0.8 of the Bitcoin Software in February 2013 and resulted in a major performance improvement in
              the Bitcoin Software because (a) the unspent transaction database was much smaller given that it no longer
              contained information about spent transactions and (b) there was no need any longer to look up the full
              transaction data in the blockchain {<b>Wuille1 [30] {C1/1/7}</b>}. Dr Wuille’s change accordingly
              introduced the concept of a pool of unspent transaction outputs. In addition, it introduced the concept of
              unspent transaction output caching, by which the software kept a subset of the unspent transaction output
              database cached in memory for faster access {<b>Wuille1 [31] {C1/1/8}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It was in the context of the development of
              Bitcoin’s treatment of unspent transaction outputs that the abbreviation “UTXO” came into being. Dr Wuille
              explains that Alan Reiner (who went by the name etotheipi) was the first person to use it. On 21 June 2012
              he posted a message on the developers’ chat that he was “<i>going to start using utxo to refer to
                unspent-txout</i>” {<b>{D1/6/11}</b> at Row 437}. Even some months later, however, the expression had
              not become well-established {see <b>Wuille1 [31] {C1/1/8}</b>}. In any event, there is no reference to the
              expression UTXO in the Bitcoin White Paper, in the Bitcoin Software or its updates released by Satoshi
              Nakamoto or in any of the voluminous emails and forum posts made by Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Professor Meiklejohn and Mr Gao were in
              agreement that the term UTXO began to be adopted in 2012 or so {<b>Meiklejohn1, [45] {G/2/16</b>}, agreed
              by Gao at <b>{Q/3/2}</b>} and Dr Wright appeared to confirm the position in his eleventh witness statement
              at <b>Wright11, [578] {CSW/1/107}</b>. That, however, presented a difficulty for Dr Wright:</p>

                  from 2008, Dr Wright’s Non-Sparse Random Graphs paper <b>{L3/230}</b>, includes a sub-heading

                  which supposedly dates back to 2007 refers to the UTXO addresses and the “UTXO pool”

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s response to this was to suggest that
              Satoshi Nakamoto had used the expression UTXO because Dr Wright used it in those three documents. However,
              the Developers estimated that around 1,000 emails or forum posts written by the real Satoshi Nakamoto are
              available to the parties and the Court. They submitted that not a single one uses the expression UTXO –
              and there was no contradiction on this point. Yet, according to Dr Wright, Satoshi is supposed to have
              used the expression UTXO in 2008 in the precise manner in which UTXO came to be used in 2012 – with UTXO
              caching and a UTXO pool - in those three documents. I do not find this to be credible.</p>

              Wright’s suggestion that he was referring to a different type of UTXO pool to that introduced by the

              referring. That document is specifically addressing the use of the UTXO pool for the purpose of checking
