            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright initially resisted looking at these
              changes on the footing that there were prior commands that needed to be considered with those changes,
              namely “<i>\vspace{5.40mm}</i>” and “<i>\begin{adjustwidth}{13.48mm}{14.81mm}</i>” {see Day15/136:3-14}.
              It is not clear why Dr Wright saw fit to mention those commands save for the purposes of distraction.
              Those commands did not change at all during the course of the changes to the spaceskip command shown above
              (as can be seen if one examines page 4 of each of the compilations at <b>{L21/29.1/4} </b>to<b>
                {L21/90.1/4}</b>). The former command had set the vertical space above the abstract. The second had set
              the width of the abstract. </p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright then sought to suggest that the entire
              process of adjustment illustrated by the above was a demonstration:</p>

                  of a process of iterative adjustment seeking to achieve a particular result. The iterative nature of
                  that process contradicts the further assertion (by Shoosmiths on instruction from Dr Wright) that this
                  was merely a process of seeking “<i>to undo the changes to the LaTeX code he had made since
                    publication of the Bitcoin White Paper</i>”<i>. </i>I agree.</p>

                  process either. Dr Wright did not even contend that some message was encoded in the document. If Dr
                  Wright’s White Paper LaTeX Files bear any watermark, as Counsel submitted, it is simply the smudge of
                  Dr Wright seeking incompetently to reverse-engineer the Bitcoin White Paper.</p>
