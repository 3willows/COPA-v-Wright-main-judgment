<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s contention that the PGP key was
              created in 2011 was addressed independently by both Mr Madden and by Martti Malmi.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_781"><span class="judgment-body__number">781.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Madden described the key at <b>Madden4 [144
                et seq] {G/6/46}</b>. He was able to verify the date of the key to 30 October 2008 in two ways:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">781.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, using the X-Archive-Orig fields in
                  the header of the relevant web page on the Wayback Machine, he identified that the key had been
                  uploaded to the bitcoin.org website with a date of 30 October 2008 {<b>Madden4 [149] {G/6/48}</b>}.
                </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">781.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, he was able to inspect the internal
                  timestamp of the PGP key itself, which also gave a date of 30 October 2008 {<b>Madden4 [152]
                    {G/6/50}</b>}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Malmi disclosed emails that he had exchanged
              with Satoshi Nakamoto in December 2010. On 6 December 2010 Mr Malmi had asked Satoshi to send his PGP key
              {L6/478/1}. Satoshi responded the same day, sending the PGP key and stating “<i>It’s also at </i><i><span style="color:initial"><u>http://www.bitcoin.org/Satoshi_Nakamoto.asc</u></span></i>”
              <b>{L6/477/1</b>}. The key sent by Satoshi is identical to the key analysed by Mr Madden.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_783"><span class="judgment-body__number">783.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So the evidence from those two independent
              sources established that the key was not created in 2011. </p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_784"><span class="judgment-body__number">784.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Malmi’s emails were disclosed by COPA with
              his witness statement on 28 June 2023. They presented an immediate problem for Dr Wright’s then account of
              events. His story changed in <b>Wright4</b>. He continued to state that the “<i>key was created by person
                or persons unknown</i>” (<b>Wright4 [104] {E/4/34}</b>) but now said:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>“This was generated by Vistomail when I set-up the Sakura account in 2008. I subsequently shared
                    this with a number of individuals, including Marti [sic] Malmi, so that they could send code updates
                    to me. It was only published in 2011 by an unknown party (I suspect Marti [sic] Malmi), after I
                    stopped the active use of the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.”</i></p>
</section>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_785"><span class="judgment-body__number">785.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Leaving aside the sudden reversal of the
              position previously taken by Dr Wright, his suggestion that the PGP key had been “<i>generated by
                Vistomail</i>” is wrong. As described in [788.1 below], the key was associated by Satoshi with his <span style="color:initial"><u>satoshin@gmx.com</u></span> account (not his <span style="color:initial"><u>satoshi@vistomail.com</u></span> address). </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_786"><span class="judgment-body__number">786.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, in addition Dr Wright had overlooked
              Satoshi’s confirmation that the key that he had sent to Mr Malmi was already on the bitcoin.org website,
              i.e. that it had been on the bitcoin.org website no later than December 2010: see paragraph 782 above. Dr
              Wright repeated this error in <b>Wright9 [34] {E/26/12}</b>, continuing to contend that the PGP key was
              posted after he “<i>ceased to be active under the Satoshi Nakamoto identity</i>”. </p>
