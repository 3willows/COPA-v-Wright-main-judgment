<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These Bitcoin cases were originally docketed to
              me due to a concern that they might involve issues of some technical complexity. It turned out that the
              issues relating to Bitcoin technology are not particularly complex, and in this section I set out an
              overview of cryptocurrency technology by way of relevant technical background. In addition, some of the
              evidence relied upon to indicate forgery (or not) raised some technical issues, but those points are best
              discussed in the context of the forgery allegations.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This section is based on Professor Meiklejohn’s
              account of the technology, which was largely agreed by Dr Wright’s expert, Mr ZeMing Gao.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency,
              originating in 2009. Bitcoin is known as a cryptocurrency because it is a cryptographic system, in that it
              relies on principles of cryptography and uses cryptographic algorithms to form and verify transactions and
              blocks. The two cryptographic primitives that Bitcoin relies on are hash functions and digital signatures.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is a peer-to-peer system, meaning users can
              transfer payments between themselves without an intermediary or central authority. Transactions between
              users are incorporated into blocks by a process called mining. These blocks are in turn distributed among
              and verified by peers on the network, who store them by adding them to a ledger. Each block added to the
              ledger includes information in the form of a hash, which is affected by the blocks added before it. This
              ledger is therefore created by linking the blocks together to form the blockchain. The contents of one
              block thus cannot be changed without changing the contents of all subsequent blocks. </p>
