<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As noted above, Dr Wright has been involved in
                various pieces of relevant litigation, in which Judgments have been delivered. Such Judgments are
                conclusive evidence of their existence, date and legal effects, and they are also admissible evidence of
                what happened in the proceedings they describe: see <i>Phipson on Evidence</i> at §§43-01 to 43-02.
                Thus, Judge Reinhart’s Judgment of August 2021 in the <i>Kleiman</i> litigation is admissible in
                describing the account Dr Wright gave of putting assets out of his reach and the “<i>bonded courier</i>”
                story he gave. However, Judgments in other proceedings are not admissible for the purpose of proving
                that the other judges’ assessments and findings are correct: the rule in <i>Hollington v Hewthorn</i>
                [1943] KB 857. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this case, Dr Wright relies on numerous
                documents said to be or to have been contemporaneous to support his claim to be Satoshi. However, the
                contemporaneous documents on which Dr Wright relies are themselves said by COPA and the Developers to be
                suspect. In many cases, more than merely suspect: I have heard a significant amount of evidence directed
                to allegations that all of the most important documents on which Dr Wright relies are forgeries. For
                case management reasons, at earlier stages in this litigation I limited the number of forgery
                allegations which COPA were allowed to level against Dr Wright and his documents. However, those limits
                do not prevent COPA from alleging additional documents are inauthentic or unreliable.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is clear that Dr Wright has a
                well-developed ability to persuade people of his technical acumen, when they do not fully understand
                what he is talking about. In other words, he can talk a good story. His ability should not come as a
                surprise because he has been working for over a decade to establish himself as Satoshi Nakamoto.
                However, when his story is exposed to detailed forensic analysis, as occurred during this trial, it is
                found to be riddled with inconsistencies, but, most importantly, to be founded on a whole series of
                documents which I find to have been either forged or to be unreliable. The detail of my findings is set
                out below.</p>
