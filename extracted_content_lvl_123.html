<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his first witness statement, Dr Back
              described and exhibited his brief email exchanges with Satoshi Nakamoto in August 2008 and later in
              January 2009. He said these emails had never previously been published (as related above at [23.2]). These
              emails do not show Dr Back being dismissive at all.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his second witness statement, Dr Back
              responded to the parts of <b>Wright1</b> in which he had been mentioned. His evidence shows the following:

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That Dr Wright’s claim to have been
                  profoundly influenced by Wei Dai’s b-money proposal was a lie, since Satoshi’s first email to Dr Back
                  shows that Satoshi was not previously aware of that proposal, a point confirmed by Wei Dai (see
                  above).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That Dr Wright’s claim that Dr Back was
                  dismissive and had said that digital cash had been attempted before and was bound to fail, was a lie.
                  Far from being dismissive, Dr Back points out he was one of the applied researchers who continued to
                  work on making p2p electronic cash a reality, after the failure of Digicash in 1998. He also said that
                  Hashcash was a building block used by others in their designs, including Wei Dai in 1998, Nick Szabo
                  in 1998 and Hal Finney in 2004.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition, Dr Back responded to Dr Wright’s
              claim in <b>[94] </b>of<b> Wright1</b> that Bitcoin uses an algorithm derived from Tuomas Aura’s 2000
              paper and not Hashcash. Dr Back gave a series of detailed chronological and other reasons why he did not
              think this was correct, not least the fact that his Hashcash paper is cited in the Bitcoin White Paper
              (reference [6]), but there is no reference at all to the paper by Aura et al. Dr Back also stated that the
              proposals in his Hashcash paper and that of Aura et al are different in that Aura’s work is about an
              interactive client-server protocol, while Hashcash is a non-interactive proof. He pointed out that
              Bitcoin, being peer-to-peer, necessarily cannot involve a server. In this regard, it is relevant to note
              that Satoshi actually wrote, in the Bitcoin White Paper, ‘<i>we will need to use a proof-of-work system
                similar to Adam Back’s Hashcash [6],’ </i>and made no mention of Aura.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Professor Meiklejohn addressed proof-of-work
              systems in her first report at <b>[62]-[63]</b>, making the point that proof-of-work is not unique to
              Bitcoin. In respect of Bitcoin, she made the straightforward point that the specific type of proof-of-work
              used in Bitcoin is derived from a previous proposal called Hashcash, as proposed by Adam Back in 2002, as
              referred to in the Bitcoin White Paper.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_687"><span class="judgment-body__number">687.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright then responded in <b>Wright11</b>. In
              <b>Wright11 at [387]</b>, Dr Wright responded to Dr Back’s mention that Satoshi cited his Hashcash paper
              in the Bitcoin White Paper with this statement: ‘<i>I did so because I mentioned it in the White Paper,
                not because I used the algorithm’</i>, an explanation<i> </i>which I consider to be bizarre, given what
              Satoshi actually wrote. Dr Wright went on to refer to the algorithm used in Hashcash as being different
              from that implemented in Bitcoin, on the basis that ‘<i>the algorithm does not use a series of leading
                zeros as Bitcoin implements.</i>’</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Similarly, later in <b>Wright11</b>, Dr Wright
              sought to respond to Professor Meiklejohn’s first report at <b>[62]-[63]</b> and the first and second
              witness statements of Dr Back, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘I will note that the initial Hashcash scheme and the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism differ
                    in their core concept and the specifics of their implementation, </i></p>

<section>
<p><i>particularly in how the target for hash collision is defined.’</i></p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_689"><span class="judgment-body__number">689.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>[601</b>] he sought to summarise how he
              saw the differences. Under the sub-heading of ‘Bitcoins’s Proof of Work’ he said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘e. Target with Leading Zeros: In Bitcoin's PoW, the goal is to find a hash that is below a
                    particular target value, often visualized as a hash with a certain number of leading zeros. This
                    target adjusts over time to maintain a consistent block time despite changes in computational power.
                  </i></p>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">f.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Mechanism: Bitcoin miners compete to
                      find a hash of the block header that meets the required difficulty level (i.e., has a sufficient
                      number of leading zeros). The difficulty of this task adjusts dynamically with the network's
                      collective hashing power to ensure that the average time to find a block remains consistent.’</i>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_690"><span class="judgment-body__number">690.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is clear from these references that Dr Wright
              thought that the proof of work implemented in the Bitcoin system operated on the basis of finding a hash
              with a sufficient number of leading zeros.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_691"><span class="judgment-body__number">691.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for Dr Wright put to Dr Back that the
              Bitcoin code had retained the approach of simply checking leading zeros as described in the Bitcoin White
              Paper. Presumably this was done on instructions and/or the basis of what Dr Wright said in
              <b>Wright11</b>. Dr Back explained that although the Bitcoin White Paper refers to leading zeros, no
              released version of the Bitcoin code utilises that. As he explained, </p>
<blockquote>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In re-examination, Dr Back confirmed that in the
              Bitcoin code there is no check for leading zeros:</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although in Written Closing, Counsel for Dr
              Wright spent many paragraphs seeking to persuade me that <b>Wright1 [94]</b> was a fair and accurate
              description of a technically complex issue, I am not so persuaded. In fact, as I have mentioned, I find
              <b>[94] </b>(and the surrounding paragraphs) to be fabrication by Dr Wright. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is unnecessary to get into the rather fine
              distinctions which were explored in cross-examination of Dr Back when comparing the methodologies of Aura
              et al, Hashcash and Bitcoin. Dr Back answered all the points put to him fairly and carefully. It may be
              true that when one conducts a detailed comparison of these three methodologies, the proof-of-work system
              described in the Bitcoin White Paper ‘<i>aligns more closely with the methodology described in Aura’s
                paper than with Dr Back’s original proposal’</i>. But that is an exercise using 20:20 hindsight. What
              Satoshi actually did appears to be much more straightforward. He referred to Adam Back’s Hashcash paper
              because he was aware of it and, as he stated in the Bitcoin White Paper, his proposed proof-of-work system
              was similar to it. Either Satoshi was unaware of the proposal by Aura et al, or he considered it
              different, possibly for the reason given by Dr Back.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_695"><span class="judgment-body__number">695.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s explanation in [94] does not make
              sense. If Satoshi had based his proof-of-work algorithm on Aura et al, he would have cited that paper. The
              fact that Aura had supposedly not responded (per Dr Wright) would not have been a reason not to cite the
              paper. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In fact, there is a ready explanation as to why
              Dr Wright got all this wrong. It has become apparent to me that his <i>modus operandi </i>when pursuing
              his claim to be Satoshi is to do whatever he can to read and research all available materials so he is in
              a position to speak with authority on what happened/he did as Satoshi. This strategy is not foolproof. It
              comes unstuck if what Dr Wright thinks happened conflicts with (a) testimony from those who were actually
              involved at the time or (b) previously unpublished materials. This is yet another instance where Dr Wright
              has come unstuck. Furthermore, it appears he did not apply this strategy to the Bitcoin Source Code.
              Consistent with (a) the relatively few forgeries relating to the code and (b) the points he got wrong as
              regards the code, it would appear he had not analysed or familiarised himself with the code.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is, of course, an additional problem with
              <b>Wright1 [94], Wright11 [387] </b>and<b> [601]</b>. In those paragraphs, Dr Wright got wrong the
              proof-of-work system which Satoshi actually implemented in the Bitcoin Source Code, as Dr Back explained.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, there are a number of independent
              pieces of evidence which combine to present, in my judgment, an overwhelming case that Dr Wright did not
              write the Bitcoin Source Code, either by himself or with others. Once again, his evidence that he did is
              fantasy.</p>
