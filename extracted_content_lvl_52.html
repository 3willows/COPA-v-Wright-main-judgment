                  in OpenOffice 2.4 (a finding consistent with the metadata of the public Bitcoin White Paper versions).

                  producing a replica of the White Paper does not do so, instead exhibiting substantial discrepancies
                  from it.</p>

                  into LaTeX source code to make something superficially similar is not too difficult. </p>

                  copy at all resembling the White Paper because it uses software not available in 2008/9.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After their Joint Statement, Mr Rosendahl served
              his second report (on 12 February 2024) to address two sets of metadata information and their associated
              files, which related to the project editing history of the LaTeX files he had analysed in his first
              report.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I have related, Dr Wright did not rely on Mr
              Lynch’s evidence. Mr Rosendahl came to London to be cross-examined in person. He is obviously extremely
              knowledgeable about LaTeX and he gave his evidence carefully, precisely and with obvious honesty. He was
              an ideal expert witness.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although Dr Wright jettisoned Dr Placks and Mr
              Lynch as witnesses, I am grateful to them for their work. I should add I have no reason to conclude that
              they acted other than entirely in accordance with their duties as experts to be objective and independent.
              Both made and agreed findings adverse to Dr Wright and (although it does not matter for any of my
              conclusions) it is likely that their objective and independent approaches were the very reason why Dr
              Wright jettisoned their evidence.</p>
