<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">During his time working with Lasseter’s Online
              Casino, Dr Wright claimed that his work there on robust security and logging, along with distribution of
              logs, led to the creation of an early precursor of the blockchain. It was his time at Lasseter’s that he
              says “<i>planted the seeds that would later germinate into the idea of Bitcoin</i>”. Similarly, Dr Wright
              charted his further career development working at Vodafone as being significant to how he would create
              Bitcoin. He said that, while there, he worked on the creation of secure logging and payment channels, with
              all system events and transactions being carefully tracked. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, all the contemporaneous evidence of Dr
              Wright’s work with Lasseter’s and Vodafone (including in his own CV and profile cited above in [586])
              describes it as straightforward IT security work. Based on the documents and the evidence of Dr Wright’s
              own witnesses (Mr Archbold and Mr Jenkins), his work involved putting together online security features,
              such as firewalls. It would appear that nothing in his work for either company was out of the ordinary for
              IT security work which is carried out for many companies every day. Dr Wright strained to characterise
              working on logging systems (totally normal for IT security) as being somehow a precursor to Bitcoin and
              suggested a continuing professional thread, ineluctably leading towards the creation of Bitcoin. I find
              that the reality is that these were simply IT security projects over a few years in the IT security
              sector, and nothing to do with the creation of a revolutionary cryptocurrency. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Under cross-examination Dr Wright sought to
              distance himself from his various CVs, all of which painted a picture of him being a competent IT security
              professional. He blamed this on the fact that they were either written by others or tailored for certain
              jobs. However, even on his own account the various alternative CVs all concerned work in IT security,
              computer audits or digital forensics. The overriding point is that he cannot point to reliable
              contemporaneous documents showing what he claims was his special expertise and interest in digital cash
              and transaction systems.</p>
