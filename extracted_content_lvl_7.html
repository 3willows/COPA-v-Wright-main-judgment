              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright was born and raised in Australia,
                and spent most of his life there until 2015, when he moved to the UK. He claims to have earned more than
                16 Master’s degrees and two doctoral degrees, including a PhD in Computer Science and Economics from
                Charles Sturt University.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his evidence, Dr Wright relied on much of
                his employment history as giving him a unique series of stepping stones towards his claimed development
                of Bitcoin. I discuss those aspects below. Here I relate his employment history and introduce various
                people who gave evidence in support of his claim.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the early to mid-1990s, he worked at
                OzEmail (an ISP in Australia) as a corporate account manager. In 1997-1998, he held a post as IT
                security consultant for the Australian Stock Exchange, where he developed IT security systems. </p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">From 1997 to 2003 he worked primarily through
                DeMorgan Information Security Systems Ltd (“<b>DeMorgan</b>”), an IT security consultancy business that
                he founded. In 1998, DeMorgan was engaged by Lasseter’s Online Casino. During that time, he worked on
                “<i>designing the [IT] security architecture</i>” for Lasseter’s. It was during his time at Lasseter’s
                when he first came into contact with Mark Archbold. From 1998 to 2002, DeMorgan worked with Vodafone on
                IT security project work which involved implementing a firewall system. Whilst working with Vodafone, he
                met Rob Jenkins (“<b>Mr Jenkins”</b>).</p>

                  shares in DeMorgan.  They later gave undertakings to the Court not to compete with the new
                  shareholder.  Dr Wright was subsequently held in contempt for breach of those undertakings.  At first
                  instance and on appeal, the Courts rejected a key claim by Dr Wright that an email found on his
                  computer had been fabricated </span><b><span style="color:#1D1D1D">{L1/334/1}</span></b><span

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In late 2004, Dr Wright started work as an
                Associate Director of Information systems with the accountancy firm, BDO Kendalls (“<b>BDO</b>”). His
                work is said to have involved IT audits, digital forensics and fraud prevention {see <b>Wright1 [48]</b>
                <b>{E/1/10}</b> plus his 2007 CV at <b>{L2/102/1}</b> and his 2015 LinkedIn profile at
                <b>{L11/130/6}</b>. From 2005, Dr Wright as part of a BDO team provided services to CentreBet, an
                Australian sports betting site. During the course of that work, he first met Stefan Matthews (<b>“Mr
                  Matthews”</b>), who was then CIO of CentreBet.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">While working at BDO, Dr Wright from 2006 to
                2008 undertook an LLM at the University of Northumbria, with his dissertation focusing on the legal
                status and liabilities of internet intermediaries. From 2007 to 2008, Dr Wright was also heavily
                occupied with studying for a series of IT security qualifications and with writing books and papers on
                IT security, regulation and audit.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#000000">Dr Wright was made
                  redundant from BDO in November or December 2008, with his formal employment ending in January 2009.
                  After that redundancy, he actively put himself forward for work focussed on IT security, and on 22
                  January 2009 he published a blog “A Return to Consulting”, in which he put himself forward as an
                  expert in IT security and audit {see </span><b><span
                    style="color:#000000">{Day6/38:12}</span></b><span style="color:#000000"> - </span><b><span

                    style="color:#000000">{L9/97/1}</span></b><span style="color:#000000"> (the blog)}. In 2009, he
                  started the companies Information Defense Pty Ltd and Integyrs Pty Ltd. Over the following years, he
                  founded a series of other companies. It was also from 2009 that Dr Wright found himself the subject of
                  investigations by the Australian Tax Office (“</span><b><span
                    style="color:#000000">ATO</span></b><span style="color:#000000">”), which I have to discuss in
                  greater detail below. Around late 2010, Dr Wright’s first marriage to Lynn Wright was failing, and
                  they separated officially in January 2011.</span></p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The ATO investigations continued until about
                2016. In some of these, Dr Wright made claims about mining large amounts of Bitcoin in the early days of
                the Bitcoin system, in conjunction with Dave Kleiman, who died in 2013. On 11 February 2014, Dr Wright
                sent an email to Louis Kleiman, Dave Kleiman’s father, to tell him that Dave (along with himself) was
                one of the three people behind Bitcoin. </p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This email eventually led to a claim by Ira
                Kleiman (Dave Kleiman’s brother, but acting in his capacity as the personal representative of the estate
                of Dave Kleiman) and W&amp;K Info Defense Research LLC against Dr Wright brought in the United States
                District Court for the Southern District of Florida (<i>Kleiman v Wright</i> (Case No.
                18-cv-80176-BLOOM/Reinhart)). See further below.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems that Dr Wright reconnected with Mr
                Matthews by meeting up on 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2014 in Sydney. This was a social occasion, but it
                seems to have led to Mr Matthews introducing Dr Wright to Robert MacGregor of nTrust in Canada by email
                on 3 February 2014. This introduction apparently led to a short conversation between Dr Wright and Mr
                MacGregor but nothing came of that conversation at the time.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_36"><span class="judgment-body__number">36.</span>
            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright next contacted Mr Matthews in around
                April 2015 by phone. In the call, Dr Wright told Mr Matthews he had a number of issues he wanted to
                discuss with him about his business in Australia. Mr Matthews recalls Dr Wright being quite anxious. On
                his next trip to Australia in April or May 2015, Mr Matthews had a lunch meeting with Dr Wright, Mr
                Allan Pedersen who worked for the DeMorgan Group running research programmes and Dr Stephane Savanah, an
                academic with a research role also in DeMorgan. Although there are aspects of what Mr Matthews says
                happened on that day which are controversial, it seems that Mr Pedersen and Dr Savanah were interested
                in persuading Mr Matthews to invest (millions) into their research into blockchain technology and
                Bitcoin, whereas Dr Wright remained anxious about the issues which DeMorgan were facing in terms of
                R&amp;D grants which they had applied for and the related difficulties with the Australian Tax Office.
                Mr Matthews says that his research on the internet after the lunch was the first time he encountered the
                name Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr Matthews had dinner with Dr Wright later that day. Mr Matthews says he asked
                ‘who is Satoshi Nakamoto?’ to which he says Dr Wright replied ‘you already know the answer to that
                question’, whereupon Mr Matthews says he asked for a straight answer. In his witness statement here, Mr
                Matthews says Dr Wright replied ‘you are looking at him’, whereas in his evidence in <i>Granath</i>, Mr
                Matthews said that Dr Wright replied with ‘I am’.</p>

          </section>
          <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_37"><span class="judgment-body__number">37.</span>
            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After an apparently long explanation from Dr
                Wright about him being Satoshi, the conversation turned to the difficulties at DeMorgan. Dr Wright
                explained he wanted to protect his intellectual property, continue his research but not have anything to
                do with running companies, something he felt he was not good at. He wanted to push his ideas into a
                company which could turn them into ‘valuable solutions’.</p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_38"><span class="judgment-body__number">38.</span>
            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Matthews discussed the situation with Mr
                Ayre, a friend of his, who suggested that they introduce Dr Wright to Mr MacGregor since his company
                nTrust was involved in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. This resulted in Mr Matthews and Dr Wright
                flying to Vancouver in late May 2015, to meet with Mr Ayre and then with Mr MacGregor. The initial
                encounter with Mr MacGregor did not go well, but Mr Matthews persevered which resulted in he and Mr
                MacGregor travelling to Sydney and spending some time in the offices of DeMorgan. Again, there are
                aspects of Mr Matthews’ evidence on this encounter which are controversial, but the end result was that
                Mr MacGregor got involved in the creation and initial funding of what Mr Matthews describes as the
                nCrypt project.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A ‘first version’ of a ‘Heads of Terms’
                document was signed on 29 June 2015 <b>{ID_004127}</b>. Mr Matthews says the basic idea was to transfer
                the IP from the DeMorgan Group to a new company within the nCrypt group (now called the nChain group),
                with Dr Wright as Chief Scientist continuing his research activities. Mr Matthews says this was a rushed
                process because DeMorgan had to pay its solicitors, Clayton Utz, substantial fees (between 1-1.2m Au$)
                by 30 June 2015. The payment was organised by Mr MacGregor. A second version of the ‘Heads of Terms’ was
                signed on 30 June 2015 to remove the provision in the first version that Dr Wright and his wife would
                have equity in the new company.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Matthews says that part of the plan was for
                Dr Wright to move to the UK (along with his family) to work as nCrypt’s Chief Scientist at its base in
                London. He and his family made trips to London in or around September/October 2015 to find schools and
                to look at a property in Wimbledon leased for them by one of Mr MacGregor’s companies. Their belongings
                were packed up and shipped to the UK, with Dr Wright and his family moving into a serviced apartment in
                Sydney.</p>

                flying to Manila that same day and organised a ticket for Dr Wright, on the basis that the plans were
                already in place for Dr Wright to move to the UK. Thus, it appears that Dr Wright managed to evade the
                authorities in Australia and spent a couple of days in Manila before travelling onto London.</p>
