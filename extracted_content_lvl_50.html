            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA submitted that Mr Gao’s articles and posts
              demonstrate an extraordinary lack of independence and objectivity, citing the following examples. In his
              recent self-published book, he treats Dr Wright as a messianic figure, misunderstood by the world

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his blog posts and articles, Mr Gao committed
              his personal credibility to the position that Dr Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto and made clear his strong
              desire to see Dr Wright prevail in this litigation. Under cross-examination, he admitted that attitude

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His lack of independence extended to a personal
              hostility to COPA, claiming that its approach in these proceedings is to trick the court {<b>{Day18/66:10}
              </b>and blog at <b>{L19/264/1}</b>}, and disputing its stated motivation for bringing this claim. Finally,
              and tellingly, he maintained in that there was no error of judgment in him continuing to post such
              articles after he had been instructed as an expert, and even in the run-up to trial <b>{Day18/75:20}</b>.

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I agree that certain aspects of Mr Gao’s report
              lacked independence and objectivity and, in view of his publicly stated view of Dr Wright, I would be very
              cautious about relying on any of his evidence which conflicted with that given by Professor Meiklejohn.
              However, on the important matters – the signing sessions and the technical aspects of cryptographic proof,
              he did not dispute Professor Meiklejohn’s evidence.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, COPA submitted that one feature of his
              evidence demonstrated his lack of independence. This was where he attempted to make arguments about the
              meaning of the Sartre blog post. While accepting that it was not the cryptographic proof which Dr Wright’s
              backers, the journalists, Mr Andresen and Mr Matonis expected it to be, Mr Gao sought to argue that it was
              apparent from the words of the post that it was not offering such proof. Since the matters of technical
              content are not in dispute, the meaning of the blog post is not a matter for expert evidence. So I give no
              weight at all to Mr Gao’s efforts to argue for a particular interpretation of the post.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Notwithstanding the trenchant attack on Mr Gao’s
              independence, I am not sure his lack of independence really affected anything I have to decide. As COPA
              submitted, during his cross-examination Mr Gao accepted the following points (which were all the points
              which COPA needed):</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All that is needed for a digital signature
                  to be verifiable and avoid a replay attack is that the verifier has ensured that a known, new message
                  is being used. It does not improve security for the person signing to add anything to the message
                  {Day18/5:17}. So, there was no good reason for Dr Wright to add “CSW” to the message chosen by Mr
                  Andresen in the signing session with him.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All that is required for a simple and
                  subversion-proof signing session is for someone to sign a new message (chosen by the verifier), and
                  send the signature or put it onto a USB and hand that over. The verifier can then run verification
                  software against the relevant public key and the known message on their own computer, even without
                  connecting to the internet. This could be done in a matter of minutes <b>{Day18/7:13} -
                    {Day18/9:24}</b>.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A public proof of possession of a private
                  key may be given by signing an obviously new message with the key and publishing the digital
                  signature. Anyone can then verify the signature for themselves. There is no risk of the private key
                  being compromised (i.e. found out) by this process <b>{Day18/11:3} - {Day18/12:1}</b>.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There were straightforward means for all the
                  signing sessions to be spoofed, including both with the journalists, the one with Mr Matonis and the
                  one with Mr Andresen. Moreover, this could have been done in such a way that no clear warning was
                  visible – see the whole section at <b>{Day18/17:3} - {Day18/33:1}</b> – regarding Mr Gao’s agreement
                  with the technical steps set out in Ms Meiklejohn’s evidence about how the signing sessions could be
                  subverted.</p>

                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It was not necessary to spend the time and
                  effort to download the Bitcoin Core software or the entire blockchain in order to conduct the signing
                  sessions, and doing so did not confer any benefit in terms of security or preventing subversion
