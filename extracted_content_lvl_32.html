      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright denied the authenticity of emails from
        him at the email address <span style="color:initial">cwright@tyche.co.uk</span>. His account can be seen
        from the following exchange <b>{{Day7/109:9} - {Day7/110:3}}</b>. From that point, every time he was taken
        to a Tyche email he denied it was from him}:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <section>
          <p><i>‘Q. <b>{L11/54/1}</b>, please. This is an email dated 25 November 2015, ostensibly from you,
              “cwright@tyche.co.uk", to Mr MacGregor and others. Do you say that this is another non-genuine
              email, something you didn't write?</i></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>A. I didn't write it, no. Tyche is a British company belonging to Rob that I never worked for.</i>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>Q. So all this content saying -- referring to the original White Paper being a good start and
              engaging with Mr MacGregor's ideas, that's all fake content, is it? </i></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>A. I've no idea what it is.</i></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>Q. Are you aware who supposedly created these non-genuine documents, Dr Wright?</i></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>A. Probably someone at Tyche.</i></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p><i>Q. Who are you fingering for this?</i></p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thus, Dr Wright denied that he had ever worked
        for Tyche Consulting Ltd. He blamed an unknown third party for faking his email, but could not say who
        that was or why they had done so. Furthermore, as with so many of the Tyche emails, it is implausible that
        this email was faked, since it is authentic to 2015 and it says precisely what one would have expected Dr
        Wright to say. As COPA submitted, it even includes his characteristic mistake of spelling Dr Back’s name
        as “Black”.</p>

  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_141"><span class="judgment-body__number">141.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, there are a number of apparently
        authentic documents which evidence that he did work for Tyche:</p>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">141.1.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, there is a Tyche Consulting Contract
            bearing Dr Wright’s signature <b>{L10/426/1}</b>. When this was put to him he could only claim that
            his signature had been forged <b>{Day8/5:22)} - {Day8/7:7}</b>, but did not identify who might have
            done it or why. </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">141.2.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, his employment with the company was
            recorded in the Implementation Deed of January 2016 <b>{L11/285/10}</b> giving effect to the Heads of
            Terms he had agreed in June 2015. He had already admitted that that was a genuine document, so he
            could only say that he had not read it and that the reference to his employment with Tyche Consulting
            Ltd was wrong <b>{Day8/6:15} - {Day8/16:10}</b>. </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">141.3.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, contemporaneous emails show Mr
            Matthews and Tyche Consulting Ltd arranging Dr Wright’s salary package and demonstrate that this
            employment was used for Dr Wright’s visa to move to the UK as he left Australia in late 2015 {see the
            email at <b>{L10/385/1}</b>}.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">141.4.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Matthews confirmed that Dr Wright had
            indeed been employed by Tyche Consulting Ltd and that this employment was crucial for the visa
            <b>{{Day11/144:19} - {Day11/145:24}</b>}, and provided independent details about the arrangements as
            explained in more detail below.
          </p>

      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">141.5.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, there is also in disclosure a
            documentary record of a TUPE transfer of Dr Wright’s employment from Tyche Consulting Ltd to The
            Workshop Technologies with effect from 1 February 2016 (demonstrating that he was employed by Tyche
            Consulting Ltd previously) <b>{L11/329/1</b>}, although this document was not put to him in
            cross-examination. </p>

  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_142"><span class="judgment-body__number">142.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In total, Dr Wright disclosed around 20 emails
        from <span style="color:initial"><u>cwright@tyche.co.uk</u></span>, without once mentioning that these
        were not his own emails. Furthermore, the DRD identifies this as one of his email addresses
        <b>{K/2/25}</b>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_143"><span class="judgment-body__number">143.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, the evidence shows that Dr
        Wright was lying when he said none of the emails sent from <span
          style="color:initial"><u>cwright@tyche.co.uk</u></span><span style="color:initial"><u> </u></span>were
        sent by him.</p>
