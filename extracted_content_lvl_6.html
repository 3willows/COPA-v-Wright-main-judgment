          commencement of the COPA action are based on the short chronology agreed before Trial, supplemented by
          some uncontroversial dates drawn from various witness statements.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By way of background, it is generally
              accepted that the earliest concept of digital cash was devised by an American cryptographer called
              David Chaum who proposed a form of token currency in the early 1980s which could be transferred
              safely between individuals, supported by encryption tools. In the 1990s, several further electronic
              currency systems were proposed, including E-Gold (Dr Jackson and Mr Downey); Bit Gold (Nick Szabo);
              B-Money (Wei Dai); and Hashcash (Dr Adam Back). Hashcash used a proof-of-work algorithm, as many
              modern cryptocurrencies do. </p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bitcoin is based on concepts first set out
              in the Bitcoin White Paper, the full title of which is: “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
              System”. It was written by Satoshi Nakamoto, which is agreed to be a pseudonym.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 20 August 2008, Satoshi contacted Dr
              Back by email, referring him to a draft of the White Paper hosted on the “upload.ae” site and asking
              to check a reference to his paper on Hashcash. Dr Back replied on 21 August 2008, informing Satoshi
              about Wei Dai’s B-Money Paper. On 22 August 2008, Satoshi then wrote to Wei Dai to check the
              reference for that paper. These early emails contain abstracts of the draft paper. It should be
              noted that the Satoshi / Wei Dai emails were published before these proceedings, while the Satoshi /
              Adam Back emails were not.</p>

              account (i.e. the nakamoto2 Account) at SourceForge. He used this account to create a project,

              White Paper by posting a link to it (on the bitcoin.org website). He sent an email to the “metzdowd
              cryptography mailing list” (“<b>the Metzdowd List</b>”) (a group of individuals interested in
              cryptography) directing them to the link on the “bitcoin.org” site, where the document was hosted.
