<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The various articles arising out of the
        interviews described above were initially embargoed, then released on 2 May 2016. On the same day, a post
        on Dr Wright’s blog was released entitled “<i>Jean-Paul Sartre, signing and significance</i>”
        <b>{L18/257/1}</b>. The post began by acknowledging the significance of him signing messages as Satoshi.
        It then described a process of verifying cryptographic keys by signing a quotation from Sartre. The
        issuing of this blog post was a key part of the plan for the Big Reveal of Dr Wright as Satoshi. The
        articles by the Economist and GQ referred to the blog post and indicated that its purpose was to
        demonstrate possession of the private key linked to block 9 (a block associated with Satoshi because of
        the Hal Finney Bitcoin transfer).

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Within hours of the Sartre blog post being
        issued, articles were published making the point that the post had not presented any proof at all, since
        the signature provided had been of 2009-era Bitcoin transaction that was publicly available on the
        blockchain (see for example a post by Dan Kaminsky at <b>{L13/171/1}</b>. As is explained in the post, it
        required analytical work involving special software to search the public blockchain and establish the
        falsity of the “proof”). The Economist immediately published a piece saying that his proof had come under
        fire and that it had requested a corrected version. Dr Wright now accepts that the blog post did not prove
        his possession of any private key, but says that (contrary to what others plainly expected) it was not an
        attempt to prove he was Satoshi {<b>Wright 1 [219]</b> <b>{E/1/37}}</b>. Dr Wright also said in
        {<b>Wright1 [223-224]</b> <b>{E/1/38}}</b> that his version of the Sartre post was edited by Mr MacGregor
        and that the version posted differed from what he had intended. Dr Wright’s draft post (attached to an
        email of 29 April 2016) is available. Although the introduction is different, the technical content
        appears to be virtually identical.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When the blog post was issued, Dr Wright was on
        a brief trip to Paris, and he travelled back to London that day. Meanwhile, his own team went into a
        panic. In a series of communications, Mr MacGregor, Mr Matthews and Mr Ayre pressed him to provide a
        proper, verifiable proof that he controlled keys to addresses linked to Satoshi. The email traffic shows
        that Mr Matonis and Mr Andresen reacted with a sense of betrayal. In his evidence in the <i>Kleiman</i>
        litigation, Mr Andresen said: <i>“He certainly deceived me about what kind of blog post he was going to
          publish, and that gobbledygook proof that he published was certainly deception, if not an outright
          lie.</i>” <b>{E/17/154}</b>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In cross-examination, Dr Wright for the first
        time disavowed his part in the emails which followed the debacle of the Sartre blog post. He claimed that,
        because the emails attributed to him came from an email address at nCrypt, they could not be relied upon.
        He said that “<i>my email at nCrypt was actually taken over and I was excluded from it</i>”. As with his
        unheralded disowning of the emails from him at a Tyche Consulting address, it is easy to see why he
        disputed the authenticity of these emails. They tell a story of him reacting to the discrediting of the
        Sartre blog post by claiming that the wrong copy had been uploaded, whereas he now says that the blog post
        had never been intended to provide cryptographic proof that he was Satoshi. The emails also tell a story
        of him committing to provide further proof in various forms and then failing to make good on those
        promises. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is convenient for Dr Wright now to disown
        these emails. However, as explained below, it is also wildly implausible. The other participants in the
        emails (including Mr Matthews and Mr Andresen) have accepted them as genuine, and the idea that some enemy
        of Dr Wright took over his email and made false communications with Mr Matthews and Mr MacGregor on 2 to 4
        May 2016 (when the three men were speaking regularly) without anyone finding out is absurd. Furthermore,
        Dr Wright disclosed all these emails without suggesting that any of them was unreliable. Finally, and
        remarkably, the very email which Dr Wright told me was not from him and had been sent by an impostor (the
        email of 2 May 2016 at <b>{L13/97}</b>) was and remains nominated as one of Dr Wright’s Primary Reliance
        Documents (<b>{ID_002261}</b>). It was also a document which Dr Wright reviewed for his first witness
        statement and which he did not think to mention featured false emails from someone impersonating him.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">According to Dr Wright, he had a meeting that
        afternoon (2 May 2016) at his house in Wimbledon, with Mr MacGregor and Mr Matthews, with Mr MacGregor
        pressing him to make a public transfer of Bitcoin associated with Satoshi. Dr Wright’s position is that he
        told Mr MacGregor he was not prepared to make such a transfer and that any public signing process would
        be, in his eyes, “<i>selling out</i>”. However, Mr Cellan-Jones of the BBC was told that this transfer
        would be performed, and small sums in Bitcoin were then transferred by himself, Mr Andresen and Mr Matonis
        to an address associated with Satoshi, with a view to Dr Wright having them transferred back. Moreover,
        contemporaneous emails show that Dr Wright was aware of this plan and at least initially appeared to
        support it.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 3 May 2016, Dr Wright attended a brunch in
        central London with Mr MacGregor and Mr Matthews. That afternoon, a blog entitled “<i>Extraordinary
          Proof</i>” was published under Dr Wright’s name on his blog. This blog stated that, over the following
        days, Dr Wright would “<i>be posting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for [his]
          extraordinary claim, which will include posting independently-verified documents and evidence addressing
          some of the false allegations that have been levelled, and transferring bitcoin from an early
          block</i>”. Dr Wright now says that this blog post was drafted by Mr MacGregor and that he did not
        himself review it before it was published. However, it was enthusiastically approved by an email from his
        wife, who was with him at the time. She wrote: “<i>Ok Satoshi. Your writing is REALLY impressive.</i>” She
        also mentioned that Dr Wright had emailed to suggest a modest addition to the blog post, making clear that
        he had read Mr MacGregor’s post as well and had approved it, subject to the addition. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Under cross-examination, Dr Wright disowned
        these emails, claiming that his wife’s nCrypt email had been taken over just as his had been. However, in
        my judgment, it is simply incredible that (a) this happened while remaining undiscovered at the time,
        despite this group of people being in contact face to face and by telephone regularly over these days and
        (b) Dr Wright never thought to mention in his statements or in the extensive correspondence about
        disclosure that a whole series of relevant emails over this critical period which appear to come from him
        and his wife were written by an impostor.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_884"><span class="judgment-body__number">884.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">During the afternoon and evening of 3 May and
        the morning of 4 May 2016, email exchanges continued about various forms of proof which Dr Wright might
        provide. On 4 May 2016, there were further discussions at Dr Wright’s home in which, according to Dr
        Wright, Mr MacGregor repeatedly sought to pressure him into moving Bitcoin from block 9 {<b>Wright1
          [231]</b> <b>{E/1/39}}</b>. Mr Matthews describes Dr Wright speaking over the phone to Mr Andresen and
        to suggest that there was a technical reason why the Bitcoin transfer transactions could not take place.
        However, Mr Andresen is said to have replied that the suggested problem should not arise {<b>Matthews1
          [108]</b> <b>{E/5/23}}</b>. At that point, Dr Wright apparently went up to the bathroom and cut his neck
        with a knife. He was taken to hospital and treated with the record showing that he suffered “<i>bilateral
          abrasions</i>” with “<i>no blood loss</i>” and that he was released later that day <b>{L13/360/1}
        </b>and<b> {L13/361/1}</b>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At this point, the plan for a staged revelation
        of Dr Wright as Satoshi came to an end. On 6 May 2016, a short piece was posted on Dr Wright’s blog saying
        that he did “<i>not have the courage</i>” to “<i>publish proof of access to the earliest keys</i>”. As
        explained above, the EITC Agreement which laid the groundwork for that plan was later amended and then
        terminated. Mr MacGregor ceased to have any association with Dr Wright and his companies.</p>
