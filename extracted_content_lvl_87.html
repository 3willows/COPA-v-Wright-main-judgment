      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his witness evidence Dr Wright had contended
        that the formatting of the spaces between words in the White Paper LaTeX Files was a form of digital
        watermark. He implied during his evidence on Day 5 that this was a form of steganography intended to mark
        him out as the author. If that had been so, it was a surprising oversight for Dr Wright to have omitted to
        mention the White Paper LaTeX Files in his evidence in <i>Kleiman</i>, <i>McCormack</i>, <i>Granath</i> or
        prior to October 2023 in this litigation.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for the Developers suggested that Dr
        Wright probably happened upon the idea of saying that his attempts to adjust the spacing between words in
        his White Paper LaTeX files was a digital watermark in the evening of 17 November 2023 after making all of
        his formatting changes and that he was probably inspired to promote that theory by the fact that his
        repeated entry of \; and spaceskip commands would otherwise be an obvious sign of forgery. At that point
        he chose to post mysterious references to watermarking on his Slack channel <b>{M1/2/156}</b>. The times
        are in EST. Dr Wright suggested that someone else posted this on his behalf, but could not name the
        culprit: <b>{Day15/122-123}</b>, and then when he had completed his work on the Maths (OLD) project he
        inserted two comments into BitcoinSN.tex referring to watermarking and steganography {see
        <b>{L21/16.1/696} </b>and<b> {L21/16.1/698}</b>.

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In reality, Dr Wright’s changes to the spaces
        between words were attempts by him to replicate the spacing of the Bitcoin White Paper, which (as
        explained below) was a consequence of the justification of the text in OpenOffice 2.4.</p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">An example of Dr Wright’s attempt to fiddle with
        the formatting was explored in cross-examination, it concerned his use of the spaceskip command ahead of
        the initial line of text in the abstract of the Bitcoin White Paper. That command was introduced by Dr
        Wright in Row 345 of Maths (OLD)_chunks <b>{L21/5}</b> and can be seen at <b>{L21/29.1/4}</b>: see the
        command “<i>\spaceskip=0.3em plus 3.4em minus 0.10em</i>”.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Rosendahl explained that spaceskip is a
        somewhat arcane LaTeX command <b>{Day5/139-140}</b>. Dr Wright did not seem entirely clear what the
        figures in its syntax meant <b>{Day15/131-133}</b>. However, he confirmed that the first number
        represented the base spacing, the second number reflected the amount by which the base spacing could be
        stretched and the third number represented the amount by which it could be reduced {Day15/133:8-25}.</p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having inserted the spaceskip command described
        above, Dr Wright spent a little over half an hour on 17 November 2023 adjusting its parameters to try to
        get the spacing of the first line of the abstract to fit. During the course of those changes, he changed
        the position of the line-break in the text at the end of the first line (as shown by the first purple bar
        below). The changes (which resulted in the command reading “<i>\spaceskip=0.30em plus 2.0em minus
          0.16em</i>”) can be shown as follows <b>{X/61}</b>:</p>
