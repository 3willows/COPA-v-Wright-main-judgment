        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 23 October 2023, Dr Wright’s side served
          the first report of Dr Simon Placks on forensic document analysis. On the same day the parties exchanged
          expert evidence on digital currency technology (Professor Meiklejohn for COPA and Mr ZeMing Gao for Dr
          Wright).</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA served their reply expert report
          (<b>Madden2</b>) on forensic document analysis on 17 November 2023. As Master Clark had directed,
          meetings between the respective experts took place and very helpful Joint Statements were produced,
          indicating what they agreed upon and where they disagreed.</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA served its expert evidence on ASD on 21
          November 2023 and on 30 November 2023 the ASD experts produced a helpful agreed Joint Statement.</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 8 December 2023, the Joint Statement from
          Mr Madden and Dr Placks was served. It addressed 47 of Dr Wright’s Reliance Documents. The experts
          concluded that 32 had had their metadata manipulated to record non-contemporaneous date/time values or
          are unreliable on other bases. At that stage, there was disagreement between the experts as to the
          remaining 15 of the 47. All 28 of the Reliance Documents in COPA’s list of 50 forgeries were agreed to
          be manipulated or unreliable. 17 of the Reliance Documents referred to in Dr Wright’s witness statement
          were agreed to have been manipulated or to be unreliable. In addition, the experts agreed that one of
          the sets of MYOB data purporting to show entries in 2009-2011 disclosed by Dr Wright was created in
          2020, with the other set of MYOB data (provided to Dr Placks by Dr Wright as a reaction to the problems
          with the earlier data) created in 2023 and then backdated. The significance of at least some of the MYOB
          data was that they purported to support Dr Wright’s purchase of the domain name at which the Bitcoin
          White Paper was first published.</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Meanwhile, however, 1<sup>st</sup> December
          2023 had passed without service of any reply witness statement from Dr Wright. The reasons for this
          emerged at the PTR, heard on 15<sup>th</sup> December 2023, and are explained in my PTR Judgment, handed
          down on 20<sup>th</sup> December: see [2023] EWHC 3287 (Ch).</p>
