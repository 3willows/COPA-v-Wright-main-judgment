<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In an attempt to escape the consequences of his
              inability to sign a message using Satoshi’s public PGP key Dr Wright made two separate assertions
              regarding the technical capability of the key:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">787.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, he suggested that “the PGP key is not
                  specific to any individual but to a server at Vistomail” (<b>Wright4 [105] {E/4/35}</b>). </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">787.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, he said that the key was “not a
                  signing key” (<b>Wright11 [242] {CSW/1/46}</b>) and “Only for encrypting, never for signing”
                  (<b>{Day7/143:10}</b>).</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_788"><span class="judgment-body__number">788.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, as the Developers submitted, the
              content of the key itself shows both assertions are wrong:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">788.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The key expressly identifies the user ID as
                  “Satoshi Nakamoto &lt;satoshin@gmx.com&gt;” <b>{G/6/50}</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">788.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The sigclass of the primary key is clearly
                  identified as “<i>0x13</i>” <b>{G/6/50}</b>. That sigclass is defined in the OpenPGP Message Format as
                  follows “<i>Positive certification of a User ID and Public-Key packet. The issuer of this
                    certification has done substantial verification of the claim of identity</i>” <b>{L2/202.1/20</b>}.
                  It ties the key directly to the satoshin@gmx.com address, not to “<i>a server at Vistomail</i>” or
                  “<i>person or persons unknown</i>”. Dr Wright had to admit this association: <b>{Day8/167:8}</b>.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">788.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The algorithm used in the generation of the
                  primary key is clearly identified as “<i>algo 17</i>” {<b>{G/6/50}</b> – see next to “signature
                  packet”}. Algo 17 is a DSA (i.e. a Digital Signature Algorithm) <b>{L2/202.1/62</b>}, that is to say
                  an algorithm for digital <u>signatures</u>. It is <u>not</u> an encryption algorithm. So the primary
                  key was not an encryption key: it was specifically for signing. Again, Dr Wright had to admit this at
                  <b>{Day8/166:10-11}</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">788.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The key flags for the primary key (noted
                  against the reference “<i>hashed subpkt 27 len 1</i>” at <b>{G/6/50}</b>) are shown as “<i>03</i>”.
                  Key flags are binary flags {see OpenPGP Message Format at <b>{L2/202.1/33}</b> at <b>[5.2.3.21]</b>}.
                  03 corresponds to 11 in binary and marks the key as being “<i>used to certify other keys</i>” (0x01,
                  or 01 in binary) and “<i>to sign data</i>” (0x02, or 10 in binary) {see OpenPGP Message Format at
                  <b>{L2/202.1/34}</b> top of page}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, I am satisfied that every element of
              Dr Wright’s factual and technical explanation of Satoshi’s PGP key was wrong. The Developers submitted
              that one inference to be drawn from that shortcoming in his evidence, and from the sharp change in that
              evidence following disclosure of Mr Malmi’s emails, is that Dr Wright was telling these lies to avoid the
              inference to be drawn from his failure to sign a message using Satoshi’s PGP key. I agree. However, Dr
              Wright’s erroneous understanding of Satoshi’s PGP key is yet a further indicator that he cannot be Satoshi
              Nakamoto.</p>
