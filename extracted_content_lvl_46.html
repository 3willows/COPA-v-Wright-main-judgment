<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA adduced the following documents under a CEA
              Notice:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">275.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>A letter from Mr Lucas de Groot dated 14
                    June 2023</u> explaining that the Calibri Light font was not available until 2012. This was relevant
                  to a number of Mr Madden’s findings that documents of Dr Wright are not authentic to their suggested
                  dates and have been backdated.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>A letter from Mr Michael Stathakis and Ms
                    Lee Li dated 10 July 2023</u> addressing a form of “Quill” notepad. One of Dr Wright’s Reliance
                  Documents (and a document which he has personally verified) is a set of purported BDO meeting minutes
                  from 2008 on this form of notepad <b>ID_004013</b> <b>{L2/159/1}</b>. Mr Stathakis and Ms Li explain
                  in some detail that this form of Quill notepad was not available until 2012.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>A witness statement from Mr Andreas
                    Furche</u> – Mr Furche has provided a witness statement but was not willing to give oral evidence,
                  so his evidence is now relied upon under a CEA Notice. He is a Professor and researcher in fintech. He
                  confirmed that neither he nor Professor Wrightson worked at Newcastle University after 2000 (which
                  contradicts Dr Wright’s account that he engaged with both of them over the period 2005-2009). His
                  account suggests that a series of statements Dr Wright has made about his work on the development of
                  Bitcoin in various particulars are false.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Emails in April and May 2022 from
                    Professor Graham Wrightson</u> confirming Mr Furche’s account and that he did not know Dr Wright.

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Extracts from the Lynn Wright deposition
                    transcripts from the Kleiman proceedings</u>. In cross-examination, Dr Wright sought to discredit
                  this evidence, because Lynn Wright told the US Court that Dr Wright had never mentioned Bitcoin to her
                  and had only once mentioned digital currency (evidence which conflicts directly with Dr Wright’s own).
                  He attempted this by saying that she had not been fit to give evidence due to a medical procedure and
                  treatment, and also that she had never been asked about her fitness, implying that this caused her to
                  lose her memory on the points it did not accord with his. I reject this. It is clear from the
                  transcript that at the start of her evidence she gave evidence that she was fit to testify.
                  Furthermore, her testimony in the transcript reads as clear and coherent.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>An extract from the First Witness
                    Statement of Mr John Chesher dated 1 May 2023</u> which was submitted by Dr Wright in the
                  <i>Coinbase</i> proceedings. He has provided bookkeeping and accounting services to Dr Wright and gave
                  evidence on the assets of Wright International Investments Limited. The significance of this extract
                  is that Dr Wright claims to have shared a copy of the Bitcoin White Paper with Mr Chesher before its
                  release, while Mr Chesher says that he did not meet Dr Wright until 2010.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Emails from Mr Wei Dai from October
                    2023</u> confirming, amongst other things, that Mr Dai never provided code to Satoshi, contrary to
                  what Dr Wright claimed. Wei Dai also explains that he has never worked in academia, contrary to Dr
                  Wright’s description of him as an ‘academic’. This seems to have been another guess by Dr Wright.</p>
