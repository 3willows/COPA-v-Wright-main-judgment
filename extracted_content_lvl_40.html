            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Robert Jenkins <b>{E/6/1-9}</b> made a single
              witness statement at {E/6/1-9} dated 28 July 2023, in which he set out in 37 paragraphs a fairly detailed
              account of their relationship over many years from their first meeting in 1998/1999, when Dr Wright worked
              on security measures for Vodafone in Australia, until around 2010/2011. He says that he discussed concepts
              of electronic ledgers involving linked blocks of data which in hindsight he relates to the Bitcoin
              blockchain.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His witness statement includes a section dealing
              with the time he was employed at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) from late 2002 until January
              2008 and he said:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <section>
                <p><i>‘During the time I was at CBA, which was from October 2022 [sc.2002] until January 2008, Craig and
                    I talked about a whole range of things over that five or six year period: we had a common interest
                    around some stuff that in hindsight related to Blockchain and Bitcoin (I first heard the word
                    Blockchain in late 2008, after I left CBA; I don't remember precisely when I first heard the word
                    Bitcoin, but it was later than that).’</i></p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the following six paragraphs, it is clear
              that Mr Jenkins had taken care to mention any aspect of their discussions which might possibly relate to
              Bitcoin. The next section of his witness statement, which is concerned with his next period of employment
              at BT, follows the same pattern, in which Mr Jenkins mentioned discussions with Dr Wright of a ‘white
              paper’, distributed computing, mining and bitcoin.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At the conclusion of his (first)
              cross-examination, the evidence Mr Jenkins had given was not controversial: he had discussed E-Gold with
              Dr Wright because it was an interest of his own; that there had been some discussion of buying Bitcoin
              (i.e. tokens) from Dr Wright in early 2011; that he had not received a copy of the Bitcoin White Paper
              from Dr Wright; and that he first discovered that Dr Wright was claiming to have invented Bitcoin at the
              time of the public “outing” in December 2015. When it was put to him that he could only speculate on Dr
              Wright being Satoshi Nakamoto based on hindsight, Mr Jenkins agreed and gave a vague answer about Dr
              Wright being unique and shy {<b>{Day9/91:24}</b> and following}.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, Mr Jenkins’ re-examination revealed
              that he had been prepared to answer questions in a certain way, but had not been given the chance to do so
              during cross-examination. The issue arose because Mr Jenkins had confirmed in <i>Granath</i> that he had
              not been <i>sent</i> the Bitcoin White Paper – contrary to what Dr Wright claimed. In re-examination he
              was asked: ‘Did he show you anything?’ He answered, after looking down at notes in front of him, as
              follows:</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Since that evidence had not featured in Mr
              Jenkins’ statement or in his testimony in the <i>Granath</i> proceedings, I permitted further
              cross-examination. COPA submit that Mr Jenkins’ new evidence then unravelled. He admitted that he had
              referred to a note when giving the evidence I quoted in [178], and that the note had the word “Timecoin”
              written on it. At first, he agreed that he “<i>wrote Timecoin down on that piece of paper before [his]
                evidence started</i>”. However, when it was then put to him that this was a sign of him having been
              primed by others to mention Timecoin, he contradicted the evidence he had given just moments before,
              saying: “<i>these were notes I took during the course of this interaction rather than anything I wrote
                down before the interaction</i>”. When pressed with the contradiction, he replied that he had written
              some of the notes on the piece of paper before his evidence began, but insisted that Timecoin and two
              other notes (each of several words) were written during his cross-examination. Even when it was put to him
              that he had not been seen to write anything during cross-examination, he insisted that he had
              {<b>{Day9/99:16} - {Day9/105:13}}</b>.</p>

              Jenkins contradicted himself about whether the word “Timecoin” was a note written before his evidence.
              COPA submitted that he lied about his having written notes during his cross-examination, when it was
              obvious to all in court that he had not done so. </p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I regret to say I found Mr Jenkins’ evidence
              about having seen a Timecoin paper deeply unconvincing. If he really had been shown a Timecoin paper at
              any point in the period 2007-2009, I am sure that Dr Wright would have told his lawyers and Mr Jenkins
              would have been certain to have mentioned it in his witness statement. Furthermore, I found the way in
              which this potentially important piece of evidence was elicited in re-examination was also deeply
              unconvincing. If it was known about in advance (as appears to have been the case), it should have been
              included in a supplementary witness statement or, at the very least, elicited in examination in chief.
              Instead, it seems to have been left as a bomb to go off in cross-examination, except the cross-examiner
              did not trigger the bomb, so it had to be dealt with in re-examination.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is also revealing that the first time Dr
              Wright made his claim to have shown Mr Jenkins a copy of the “Timecoin” paper was only in <b>Wright11 at
                [289] {CSW/1/53</b>, 12 January 2024}.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the circumstances, I agree that the natural
              inference to be drawn from this sequence of events is that Mr Jenkins had been primed by Dr Wright to
              bring up a “Timecoin” White Paper, something he had not mentioned in his witness statement in these
              proceedings nor in his <i>Granath</i> testimony. </p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In these circumstances, I make the following
              findings: (a) Mr Jenkins was prepared by Dr Wright to slip “Timecoin” into his evidence, and his denial of
              that was a lie; (b) he had written a note of “Timecoin” before he gave evidence to remind him to insert
              it; and (c) his claim to have written it and other notes during cross-examination was a lie. Furthermore,
              in view of my finding in section 24 of the Appendix that the Timecoin ODT Whitepaper was forged by Dr
              Wright and the evidence summarised above, I am compelled to find that <b>{ID_006565}</b>, ‘TimeDoc 2.pdf’
              was also forged by Dr Wright. In relation to finding (a) above, I wish to make clear that I do not believe
              Dr Wright’s legal team had anything to do with this, particularly in view of their exemplary conduct of
              his difficult case.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As noted above, there is nothing material in the
              balance of Mr Jenkins’ evidence which advances Dr Wright’s case on the Identity Issue. However, given the
              lies he was prepared to tell, COPA submits that in general his evidence cannot be believed except to the
              extent that it is supported by contemporaneous documents.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The final curiosity with Mr Jenkins’ evidence
              was his repeated insistence that he had been explicitly told he should not consult any documents to aid
              his memory. It was not clear who might have told him that, but COPA presumes it cannot have been the
              lawyers who took his statement. As such, it appears either that Dr Wright (or someone else associated with
              him) told Mr Jenkins not to go looking for documents, or alternatively that this was another story
              invented by or fed to Mr Jenkins to justify why he had no documents to back up his assertions. </p>

              evidence given by Mr Jenkins that in any way assists Dr Wright’s case on the Identity Issue.</p>
