<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright claimed that, by August 2011, he was
              facing the full force of the ATO investigations and, due to his concerns about them seizing his assets
              (including IP rights), he decided to put them out of his direct control. He says he did this by putting in
              trust all these assets, including bitcoin he claims to have mined since 2009 {<b>Wright1, [138-140]</b>
<b>{E/1/26}</b>}. He claimed that he stored “terabytes” of research data on a hard drive and put it beyond
              his control by encryption with a Shamir Sharing Scheme involving 15 key slices held by various
              individuals, with eight slices needed to give access.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is not necessary to relate Dr Wright’s
              various accounts about the Tulip Trust in full. Suffice to say that I agree with COPA’s submission that
              his account of the Tulip Trust appears to have been refashioned successively in the ATO proceedings, in
              <i>Kleiman</i>, in <i>Granath </i>and in this action. His evidence about the Tulip Trust in
              cross-examination {<b>{Day6/179:2}</b> - <b>{Day6/182:9}</b> and <b>{Day7/8:5}</b> - <b>{Day7/54:12}
              </b>in particular} was very confused and contradictory and parts were incredible.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_819"><span class="judgment-body__number">819.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For example, the materials provided to the ATO
              to demonstrate the existence of the Trust were the two versions of the supposed email (with trust document
              attached) from Mr Kleiman dated 24 June 2011 <b>{L7/382/1}</b> and 17 October 2014 <b>{L9/218/1}</b>
              respectively. A different Deed of Trust dated 23 October 2012 and supposedly between Wright International
              Investments Ltd and Tulip Trading Ltd was relied upon by Dr Wright in the <i>Kleiman</i> litigation
              <b>{L8/17/1}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the course of the ATO investigations, Dr
              Wright was asked to prove his control of several tranches of Bitcoin addresses, using the message signing
              feature of Bitcoin Software. He failed to do so, and came up with a series of excuses, involving transfers
              and loss of keys {Decision concerning C01N Pty Ltd of 21 March 2016 <b>{L9/382/45}</b>, at
              <b>[247-261]</b>}. Dr Wright told the ATO that Bitcoin in three addresses supposedly lent to him had not
              been spent and had been returned to Tulip Trust, including Bitcoin in an address known as 16cou {Decision
              concerning C01N Pty Ltd of 21 March 2016 <b>{L9/382/49}</b>, at <b>[266.2 </b>and<b> fn. 241]</b>}. On 16
              May 2019, the owner of that address signed a message on social media stating that the address did not
              belong to Satoshi or to Dr Wright and “<i>Craig is a liar and a fraud</i>” <b>{L17/382/46}</b>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <i>Kleiman, </i>Dr Wright was ordered
              (several times) to produce a complete list of all bitcoin that he mined prior to December 31, 2013. Dr
              Wright claimed he was unable to comply because the information was in the Tulip Trust, encrypted using a
              Shamir Sharing Algorithm, which he could not decrypt since he did not have all the necessary decryption
              keys. After an evidentiary hearing, Magistrate Judge Reinhart had to rule on whether Dr Wright had proved
              he was incapable of complying with the Court’s Orders. His ruling dated 27 August 2019
              <b>{L15/207/1-29}</b> relates how Dr Wright changed his evidence on (a) the creation of the Tulip Trust
              (and the Judge found the supposed Deed of Trust document presented by Dr Wright had been backdated), (b)
              the nature of the trust (that it was a ‘blind’ trust and he was not a trustee, yet three weeks later he
              stated in a sworn declaration that he was a trustee (of a blind trust!), (c) the trust assets (whether the
              trust contained bitcoin or, as he later asserted, the trust contained an encrypted file with the keys to
              the bitcoin, not the bitcoin itself), and (d) how the trust assets could be recovered. Dr Wright had given
              evidence that he had given away a controlling number of the key slices to David Kleiman (by then
              deceased), which was why he could not decrypt the file that controlled access to the Bitcoin. According to
              Dr Wright’s evidence, unlocking the file depended upon a bonded courier appearing on an unknown date in
              January 2020 with the decryption keys, and if the courier did not appear, then Dr Wright would have
              supposedly lost billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin, a story which Judge Reinhart considered
              ‘Inconceivable’ <b>{L15/207/19}</b>. Generally, Judge Reinhart did not believe Dr Wright and also found
              that documents presented by Dr Wright to support his position in the litigation had been altered and were
              fraudulent. Other documents conflicted with his evidence. On the evidence he heard, Judge Reinhart found
              the Tulip Trust did not exist <b>{L15/207/21}</b>.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_822"><span class="judgment-body__number">822.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA made it clear that they did not rely (and
              did not need to rely) on Judge Reinhart’s findings, but on his ruling as a record of Dr Wright’s story.

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_823"><span class="judgment-body__number">823.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By way of a further example, in a sworn
              declaration he made in <i>Kleiman, </i>Dr Wright identified David Kleiman as one of the trustees of the
              Tulip Trust <b>{L15/51/2, at [7]</b>}, yet under cross-examination before me, he said he was not
              <b>{Day7:21:8}</b>. When I put the inconsistency to him, he came up with a story about being ordered by
              Judge Reinhart to answer the question even though he did not know <b>{Day7:21}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Other glaring inconsistencies in Dr Wright’s
              evidence about the Tulip Trust were the following:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His claim that a requisite number of key
                  slices were reassembled in early 2016, giving access to a part of the drive containing private keys to
                  the early Bitcoin blocks (or perhaps an algorithm from which those keys could be produced)
                  {<b>Wright1, [187]</b> <b>{E/1/33}}. </b> This claim was necessary to make his ‘trust’ story
                  consistent with his participation in the 2016 proof sessions, yet is completely at odds with his
                  evidence in <i>Kleiman</i> about having to wait until January 2020 for the bonded courier to arrive
                  with the key slices.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The fact that the Trust document relied upon
                  in Kleiman dated 23 October 2012 was supposedly between Wright International Investments Ltd and Tulip
                  Trading Ltd, yet Dr Wright only acquired Tulip Trading Ltd as an aged shelf company in 2014.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His claim to have put all his assets
                  (including bitcoin and IP in research documents) beyond his own use, yet, on his account, both he and
                  the staff in his companies (including nChain) continued to have access and to use all these documents.
                  For example, it was never explained how he and his staff could have continued to use (and thereby
                  supposedly be responsible for altering the metadata of) the documents which Dr Wright produced as
                  precursor work to the Bitcoin White Paper, when they necessarily would have been assets in the trust
                  supposedly beyond his use.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, if all the research prior to 2012
                  had been put beyond his use, one might have thought that he would have had to have mentioned this in
                  2015 when securing funding from Mr MacGregor for the continuation of his research activities at
                  nChain. Of course, nothing to that effect was mentioned and the existence of the trust did not appear
                  to have posed any barrier at all.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Madden found a number of Tulip Trust and
              Tulip Trading Ltd documents to be ‘inauthentic’ or, as COPA put it, to bear signs of having been forged in
              2014/2015 {see Appendix PM14}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, there is strong evidence and I find
              that the Tulip Trust was another invention of Dr Wright’s, initially as part of an attempt to shield
              assets from a possible bankruptcy in Australia. Having invented it, he attempted to use it in
              <i>Kleiman</i> to avoid having to identify the bitcoin he supposedly owned, yet that attempt failed. </p>
