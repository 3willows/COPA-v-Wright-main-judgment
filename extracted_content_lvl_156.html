                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I mentioned above, under
                                cross-examination Mr
                                Hearn was the subject of robust challenge by Lord Grabiner KC on three points relating
                                to this dinner:
                                first, whether he requested to meet Dr Wright in 2016, or whether the initiative came
                                from Jon Matonis;
                                second, whether he was aware that the business for which he worked in 2016, R3, was a
                                competitor of nChain
                                and third, what occurred at the dinner. These challenges were developed in some detail
                                in Dr Wright’s
                                closing.</p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">My note made on the day Mr Hearn
                                gave evidence
                                was to the effect that Mr Hearn’s evidence was clear, in no sense overstated and that he
                                had recalled
                                matters which were important to him and he had less recall about other matters. However,
                                I have
                                reconsidered the position in the light of the submissions made by Counsel for Dr Wright
                                in their closing
                                on these three points.</p>

                                say a little
                                more about Mr Hearn’s evidence.</p>

                                2009
                                because he had a lot of questions about how Bitcoin would work out in the future. He
                                corresponded with
                                Satoshi between 12 April 2009 and 23 April 2011. He has posted ‘almost all’ of his
                                emails with Satoshi on
                                his website, so they have been publicly available for some considerable time. He was
                                referred to the brief
                                mentions of him in <b>Wright1</b>, but observed that all those events had been
                                documented by him publicly.

                                he found he
                                had exchanged emails with Dr Wright in 2014 and 2016. The email exchange in 2014 (which
                                Mr Hearn had
                                forgotten about until the emails popped up from his search) related to funding for
                                support of the core
                                Bitcoin system. Essentially, Dr Wright had asked: ‘can I fund you?’. This was not an
                                unusual issue at the
                                time as a common question was: ‘how do we support the core system?’. Mr Hearn responded
                                saying he could
                                but heard nothing further.</p>

                                                about things he had always wanted to know the answer to in relation to

                                                points which Mr Hearn
                                                recalled asking about was what the SIGHASH_SINGLE<i> </i>mode was for in
                                                the signing protocol. He said
                                                it was easy to work out what it did, but why it was there and what it
                                                was intended for was much harder
                                                to work out. Mr Hearn said that was one of the answers where Dr Wright
                                                struggled and said ‘<i>I got

                                the
                                discussion at the dinner was whether Dr Wright struggled with some of the details which
                                Mr Hearn would
                                have expected Satoshi to explain, at which point Mr Matthews intervened, or whether Mr
                                Matthews’
                                interventions were to prevent Mr Hearn probing into technical details which were the
                                subject of existing
                                or future patent filings. In support of the latter interpretation, Dr Wright asserted
                                that Mr Hearn had
                                refused to sign an NDA prior to the dinner. Mr Hearn was asked in cross-examination
                                whether he signed or

                                nChain. In his usual
                                style, Dr Wright devoted a number of paragraphs to putting some technical detail behind

                                much of which concerned the use of SIGHASH flags. Dr Wright also cited a particular GB

                                didn’t think they were competitors but said he didn’t really know what nChain’s business
                                was. This last
                                point is not a surprise because one would have to conduct a detailed analysis of

                                to understand where its business interests lay and the patent filings might cover a wide

                                software has to be concerned with scalability, which seems to me to be correct.</p>
