<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA also drew attention to the circumstances in
        which Mr Andresen arrived at and participated in the signing session that took place on 7 April 2016. His
        flight to London departed from Boston at 21:35 on 6 April 2016 (02:35 GMT on 7 April 2016), arriving in
        London around 6.5 hours later (at around 09:10 GMT). According to his deposition in the Kleiman
        proceedings he “<i>can’t sleep on airplanes very well.</i>” He arrived at the Firmdale Hotel in Covent
        Garden at around 11:00 GMT. In his Kleiman deposition, Mr Andresen repeated that at this point he was
        “<i>very tired</i>” as it was a red-eye flight. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After landing, Mr Andresen got 1-2 hours of
        sleep. According to the schedule that was prepared for the day, he then met Mr Matthews and Mr MacGregor
        for lunch at 1pm (13:00 GMT).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Following the lunch meeting, it appears there
        was an “introduction” session with Mr Matthews and Mr MacGregor, following which Mr Andresen and Dr Wright
        met in person for the first time. According to Mr Matthews they spoke for around 1-1.5 hours on a number
        of topics, including “<i>eight or ten different aspects of the Bitcoin code</i>”. According to the account
        he gave to Andrew O’Hagan for <i>The Satoshi Affair</i>, Mr Andresen “<i>was so jet-lagged at one point…
          that [he] had to stop [Dr Wright] from diving deep into a mathematical proof [Dr Wright had] worked out
          related to how blocks are validated in bitcoin.</i>”</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_867"><span class="judgment-body__number">867.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The meeting moved towards the signing session
        itself, although Mr Andresen describes the session as “<i>one continuous meeting</i>” in the hotel room.
        According to the account given in <i>The Satoshi Affair</i>, at around 5.30pm, Dr Wright logged onto his
        laptop in order to sign a message with Satoshi’s private key. Mr Andresen wished to perform verification
        using his own laptop, and produced a “<i>brand new sealed in the package USB stick</i>” which he expected
        Dr Wright to “<i>take and produce some digital signatures that [he] could verify on [his (i.e. Mr
          Andresen’s)] laptop</i>.” However, Dr Wright did not agree to do this. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_868"><span class="judgment-body__number">868.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There was then a discussion that lasted around
        15-20 minutes, following which a new laptop was “<i>procured</i>” by an assistant, which Mr Matthews has
        said was purchased from Curry’s on Oxford Street. The distance between the Firmdale Hotel and Curry’s on
        Oxford Street is 11 minutes each way by foot. It is therefore reasonable to assume that it was some time
        after 6pm by the time the assistant returned with the laptop, and the signing session continued.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_869"><span class="judgment-body__number">869.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By Mr Andresen’s account, the process of
        convincing him that Wright had taken an early block and signed a message using its private key, took
        “<i>some—many hours, I don’t recall how many hours, but it took much longer than – than expected</i>”.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_870"><span class="judgment-body__number">870.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Even if the assistant returned with the laptop
        promptly, and the signing session completed very shortly after they returned (say 7pm), this would be 16.5
        hours after Mr Andresen’s flight had departed Boston (which itself was at the end of day on 6 April Boston
        time – 9:35pm). Assuming that Mr Andresen had woken at, say, 9am on the day of his flight, and allowing
        for the time difference, by 7pm London time on 7 April (the earliest time at which the alleged signing can
        have been completed), Mr Andresen would have been through a 29-hour period since waking up on 6 April with
        only 3-4 hours of sleep. By his own account, by the time that Dr Wright allegedly signed the message, Mr
        Andresen was “<i>exhausted</i>”. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_871"><span class="judgment-body__number">871.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the technical possibility of Mr
        Andresen’s session being hacked or interfered with in some way, both Professor Meiklejohn and Mr Gao
        agreed this was all technically possible and in fact relatively straightforward. Professor Meiklejohn also
        clarified how easy it was for this to be done, noting as the final answer in her cross-examination, the
        following:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>Q. And I suggest that you have consistently understated the inherent difficulty of actually
              subverting the Andresen signing session in your reports. </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>A. That is completely inaccurate. </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>Q. The fact is that, in reality, it would have been extremely difficult to subvert the process.
            </i></p>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">A.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>I can think of literally hundreds of
                people who could compromise the router in a matter of minutes, and from there, the entire process
                would be almost trivial from a computer science perspective.</i></p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_872"><span class="judgment-body__number">872.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his evidence, Dr Wright tried to argue that
        any attempt to subvert the signing session would either have been obstructed because of the blockchain
        having been downloaded or have given rise to a clear red warning highlighting the use of a spoof website.
        Professor Meiklejohn addressed and rejected this evidence in her second report: <b>{G/10/1}</b>. Mr Gao
        accepted in cross-examination that the downloading of the blockchain would not have provided any special
        protection against spoofing and that there were various very feasible ways to subvert the process, at
        least some of which would not result in any clear warning notice.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_873"><span class="judgment-body__number">873.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, it is clear from Mr Andresen’s Reddit
        exchange with ‘etmetm’ that he wished (with the benefit of hindsight) that he had taken detailed notes of
        what happened. It seems he did not come prepared to take notes and therefore took none because they would
        be unnecessary ‘<i>because Craig would simply post a signature’ </i><b>{L14/354.1/1</b>}. In that exchange
        he also said ‘<i>We may now never know for certain if I was tricked somehow, and that might be for the
          best. (feel free to republish)’ </i><b>{L14/354.1/2</b>}. Furthermore, it is notable that Mr Andresen
        never said he and Dr Wright set up the laptop together, that was something inferred by etmetm in a summary
        of what happened - Mr Andresen responded saying he had got several details wrong.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b>The public proof session</b></p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘12. In relation to the public proof sessions, Dr Wright has explained how he was pressured by
                  Mr MacGregor into doing something he did not want to do (i.e. use a private key to prove
                  possession of an early block in the Bitcoin blockchain before his identity had been proved by
                  other means). As he put it, “[t]he only way I would have signed was: first, prove my work” [{Day
                  8/19/3-16}]. Consistent with that mindset, Dr Wright’s evidence is that the Sartre Message was
                  not intended to provide proof of possession. It was instead an act of defiance, which Dr Wright
                  says was intended to convey the message, “I’m not going to do it” [{Day 7/161/5 to 162/1}].<sup>
</sup> He saw his use of a quote from Jean-Paul Sartre as a profound demonstration of his
                  rejecting and choosing not to engage in a particular action.’ </i></p>
