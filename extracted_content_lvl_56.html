              Paper, I should mention that, perhaps not surprisingly, there were several ‘versions’ of it in disclosure.
              Mr Madden addressed this issue at an early stage. His analysis shows there were 68 documents in disclosure
              which were either versions or relations of the Bitcoin White Paper, but 24 unique documents. After
              significant scrutiny and verification via third party sources, he identified <b>{ID_000226} </b>and<b>
                {ID_000865}</b> as suitable ‘control’ copies of versions of the Bitcoin White Paper {see <b>PM3
                {H/20/14}</b>}. <b>{ID_000226}</b> has a creation date of 3 October 2008. <b>{ID_000865}</b> bears a
              creation date of 24 March 2009 and is hash identical to a file ‘Bitcoin.pdf’ from a web archive capture
              dating to 28 November 2009 from the sourceforge.net project.</p>
