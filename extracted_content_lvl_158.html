<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As part of the uncontroversial chronology, I
              mentioned how Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi gave rise to the <i>Kleiman, Granath </i>and
              <i>McCormack</i> actions, and then this COPA claim, the two passing off actions and the BTC Core Claim. It
              is not necessary to discuss the <i>Kleiman, Granath </i>and <i>McCormack</i> actions any further. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is one other claim which has been brought
              to my attention: the COBRA claim (IL-2021-000008) in which Dr Wright sued unnamed defendants as ‘The
              person or persons responsible for the operation and publication of the website <span style="color:#0563C1"><u>www.bitcoin.org</u></span> (including the person or persons using the pseudonym
              ‘C<span style="font-family:Symbol"></span>BRA’’. The claim was for infringement of copyright in the
              Bitcoin White Paper. Dr Wright secured Judgment in default of acknowledgement of service and defence by
              the Order of HHJ Hodge QC dated 28 June 2021, which includes an injunction preventing the defendants from
              infringing copyright in the Bitcoin White Paper, whether by making the Paper available for download or in
              any other way. To the extent necessary, the status of that Order can be considered at the Form of Order
              hearing following hand down of this Judgment.</p>
