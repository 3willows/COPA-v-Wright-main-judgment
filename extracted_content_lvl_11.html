                expert, Mr Madden, was served on 1<sup>st</sup> September 2023. This was a very extensive report: with
                appendices it amounts to some 970 pages, but it turned out to be the first of six reports Mr Madden
                served in these proceedings.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At a further CMC in mid-September 2023, I
                heard a number of applications, including for Dr Wright to answer a consolidated Request for Further
                Information relating to his Defence (the RFI having been served in June) and his application to adduce
                expert evidence on ASD. This resulted in my Judgment ([2023] EWHC 2408 (Ch)) and Order dated 3 October
                2023 in which I set revised directions to trial. I ordered Dr Wright to answer many of the requests, and
                he did so in two statements: Wright2 (concerning the signing sessions); and Wright4 (concerning
                remaining matters), served on 23 October 2023. Pursuant to COPA’s application, I also ordered Dr Wright
                to provide further information as to the chain of custody of his Reliance Documents.</p>
