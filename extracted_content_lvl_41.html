<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All the remaining witnesses of fact called by Dr
              Wright gave their opinion that Dr Wright was Satoshi, with varying degrees of support. They divide into
              three broad categories: family members (Max Lynam and Danielle DeMorgan), people who worked for Dr Wright
              (Dr Pang and Shoaib Yousuf) and people who encountered Dr Wright in a variety of work environments (Mark
              Archbold, Dr Jones and David Bridges).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Ms Danielle DeMorgan</u> <b>{E/8/1}</b> – Ms
              DeMorgan is Dr Wright’s youngest sister. She gave evidence that Dr Wright was interested in Japanese
              culture and sometimes used nicknames for himself. Her evidence was to the effect that, when she was 16,
              she and some of her school friends encountered in the local park someone dressed in black as a ninja with
              a Samurai sword, and this person turned out to be her brother, Craig Wright. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_203"><span class="judgment-body__number">203.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In both her statement and the blog post on which
              she based it, the key reason she drew a connection between her brother and Satoshi Nakamoto was that as a
              teenager he had dressed as a ninja in the local park. Nothing in her evidence gave any credence to Dr
              Wright’s claim to be Satoshi, and she did not support his assertion that he shared a pre-release copy of
              the Bitcoin White Paper with her. Ms DeMorgan was plainly an honest witness but her evidence was of no
              probative value. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Max Lynam</u> <b>{E/13/1}</b> – Mr Max
              Lynam is Dr Wright’s cousin. He gave evidence that he and his father ran some computer code for Dr Wright
              at their farm in Australia at some time in or after 2009, and that Dr Wright later (in 2013) told them
              that it had been mining Bitcoin.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_205"><span class="judgment-body__number">205.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should make it clear that I assessed Mr Max
              Lynam’s evidence in conjunction with the CEA evidence from his father, Mr Don Lynam, summarised below.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_206"><span class="judgment-body__number">206.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA submitted that Max Lynam’s evidence gave no
              support to Dr Wright’s claim. They pointed out that the communications he actually had with Dr Wright in
              2008 which are in disclosure say nothing about a digital currency project or anything like it
              <b>{{Day11/25:14} - {Day11/27:24}}</b>. Mr Lynam agreed that the only work or projects about which those
              communications spoke concerned IT security and digital forensics <b>{Day11/27:24}</b>. As for the code run
              for Dr Wright by Don Lynam in 2009, Max Lynam acknowledged that it was an “unknown bit of code”; that he
              did not know what it was doing; and that at the time he connected it to Dr Wright’s “White Hat” ethical
              hacking work (i.e. IT security work, which is quite different from the Bitcoin system) <b>{Day11/28:11} -
                {Day11/33:3}</b>. </p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_207"><span class="judgment-body__number">207.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, the notion that Max Lynam and
              his father were heavily involved in mining Bitcoin from the very start does not ring true. If Dr Wright,
              as Satoshi, had involved these relatively close family members in that activity then, in my judgment: </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">207.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, it is likely that Satoshi would have
                  shared the secret with them yet asked them to maintain the secret that Dr Wright was Satoshi. Yet Mr
                  Max Lynam said that there was no secrecy surrounding the running of this code. Further, prior to a
                  dinner which he dated to 2013, he had no idea of Dr Wright’s claim to have invented the Bitcoin
                  system. He could not recall having been shown the Bitcoin White Paper, as Dr Wright has claimed he
                  was. By 2013, he had only heard the word Bitcoin from the general press and he did not connect the
                  Bitcoin system with the code which he and his father had run for Dr Wright <b>{{Day11/37:19} -
                    {Day11/38:4}}</b>. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">207.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, and more importantly, Satoshi would
                  have shared at least some of the fruits of the mining with them. There are two aspects to this: </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">207.2.1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, I consider it is inconceivable
                      that Satoshi would not have told them, before they threw away the computing equipment which they
                      used, at least at some point (not necessarily right at the beginning) that they were ‘mining’ and
                      that, again at some point, they were generating Bitcoin and their Bitcoin were gradually
                      increasing in value.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">207.2.2.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, in the very unlikely event that
                      Satoshi had not told them that they were ‘mining’ prior to the disposal of the computing equipment
                      (and the hard drives, on which the resulting Bitcoin were stored) then, in my view, on learning of
                      the disposal of their equipment and their loss of their Bitcoin, Satoshi would have transferred a
                      reasonable number of Bitcoin to them. After all, Satoshi is supposed to possess over a million
                      Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">207.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my view, it is inconceivable that Satoshi
                  had them mining for some considerable time but did not transfer any Bitcoin to them for their efforts.
                </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">207.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In making these findings, I have not lost
                  sight of the fact that Bitcoin in the early days had negligible value. However, Dr Wright placed a
                  ‘nominal’ value of $50 per Bitcoin in his dealings with the ATO, so the notion that Bitcoin could be
                  ascribed some value would not have been lost on him.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">207.5.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have also not lost sight of the fact that
                  Dr Wright sought to justify never telling the Lynams to save their bitcoin on the basis that it was
                  never about value at the time <b>{Day6:142:11}</b>. This is not something which Satoshi would have
                  said: even in February 2009, he clearly envisaged the value of Bitcoin would increase and would be
                  important {see his post at <b>{L4/489/5}</b> plus his earlier email to Dustin Trammell on 16 January
                  2009 at <b>{L4/335}</b>}.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_208"><span class="judgment-body__number">208.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is also telling that Mr Lynam had no
              knowledge of documents Dr Wright later produced which suggested that he and his family had a stake in
              Bitcoin mined at an early stage {see <b>{Day11/42:20} - {Day11/45:11}</b>}. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_209"><span class="judgment-body__number">209.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, I formed two related conclusions:
              first, that Mr Max Lynam’s evidence provided no support for Dr Wright’s case; and second, that Mr Max
              Lynam for the most part, tried to tell the truth. One possible exception is the paragraph in his witness
              statement which I quote at [630]. Due to the fact that Dr Wright’s lies have been so extensive, I am
              unable to reach a conclusion as to whether he did mention the topics mentioned in that paragraph. There
              are reasons to doubt that he did, but it is unnecessary for me to reach a concluded view.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_210"><span class="judgment-body__number">210.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Dr Ignatius Pang</u> <b>{E/10/1}</b> – Dr
              Pang has known Dr Wright since 2007 and he recounted doing some analysis with Dr Wright on social network
              predatory behaviour. He claimed that, in the summer of 2008, Dr Wright used the word “blockchain” in a
              very odd conversation about a Lego Batman set (The Tumbler Joker’s Ice Cream Surprise). He also says that
              Dr Wright asked people in the office if they knew someone with a Japanese name which he now thinks was
              probably Satoshi Nakamoto. He says that this happened sometime after he had had whooping cough, which was
              in October 2008. Mr Pang accepted that his memory of both conversations from 15 years previously was
              “hazy” and had been improved by discussions with lawyers which had involved Dr Wright <b>{Day9/25:11};
                {Day9/28:10}; {Day9/32:5}</b> and following; <b>{Day9/37:2}</b> and following}. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_211"><span class="judgment-body__number">211.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA submitted that the account of the Lego
              conversation is so strange and implausible that it cannot be right, and that Dr Pang could only explain it
              by saying that Dr Wright had a tendency to “say things that are nonsensical or funny”, such as that he had
              eaten “Babe” from the engaging family film about a charismatic pig. Furthermore, the real Satoshi did not
              use the word “blockchain” in the White Paper (although it was a term that had been mentioned in relation
              to HashCash).</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_212"><span class="judgment-body__number">212.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Pang’s account that Dr Wright went around the
              BDO office asking whether they knew someone with a Japanese name which he now thinks was probably Satoshi
              Nakamoto, is intriguing for two reasons:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">212.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, the timing suggests that Dr Wright
                  had seen the first version of the Bitcoin White Paper soon after its publication.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">212.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, it seems to me to be inconsistent
                  with Dr Wright being Satoshi. The incident seems to me to be far more consistent with Dr Wright
                  finding, reading and being intrigued by the Bitcoin White Paper, and then asking whether anyone had
                  heard of the author.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_213"><span class="judgment-body__number">213.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, in closing, Counsel for Dr Wright
              placed emphasis on the fact that Dr Pang was not challenged on his evidence relating to Dr Wright’s
              improvement to the ‘<i>Diffie-Hellman equation</i>’ which he says he was shown when Dr Wright was still at
              BDO. The submission was that this is ‘relevant to Bitcoin’. That is not what Dr Pang said. He said when he
              saw the paper, he did not know how the revised equation could be applied. Only later in 2014-15, when he
              worked as casual staff at Hotwire, ‘<i>supporting the writing of blockchain related patents and/or white
                papers’, </i>and came across the paper again, did he understand that <i>‘it is to do with hierarchical
                key encryption and has very important applications in how to structure ownership of data and how things
                can be structured hierarchically in data storage, which is very important in any computer security
                setting, including Bitcoin</i>.’ The high level of generality in his link to Bitcoin is also confirmed
              by the fact that the Bitcoin system never used ECDH or Diffie-Hellman at all, but ECDSA on secp256k1 (see
              [315] below).</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_214"><span class="judgment-body__number">214.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, in my judgment, Dr Pang’s evidence
              provided no support for Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi. At best, his evidence shows that Dr Wright took
              an early interest in the Bitcoin White Paper, but no more than that.</p>

              Yousuf is a cyber security expert who has known Dr Wright since 2006. He says that in the late 2000s they
              discussed some general digital security topics and digital currency (as a broad concept). I agree with
              COPA that Mr Yousuf gave no useful evidence on the Identity Issue. All he could say was that he had rated
              Dr Wright highly as an expert in IT security and that he had spoken with Dr Wright about digital payment
              systems such as the use of Visa and Mastercard over the internet <b>{{Day9/111:1} - {Day9/112:21}}</b>. He

              Archbold has known Dr Wright since 1999 when they both worked for the online casino, Lasseter’s Online. He
              gave evidence that Dr Wright was a capable IT security professional who had a lot of computers at his home
              and at one point expressed an interest in digital currency. Mr Archbold gave honest evidence, but I agree
              with COPA’s submission that his recollections were simply of Dr Wright being a competent IT security
              professional. He was candid that he only believed that Dr Wright could “possibly” be Satoshi and that this
              belief was based on hindsight {<b>{Day10/29:6} </b>and following}. He did not support Dr Wright’s claim

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Her evidence was that Dr Wright could be Satoshi
              due to him having made three particular inventions recorded in three patents. Even if I assume this

              the first patent, all the internal documents show that the inventive work was done by Dr Savannah. She has
              personally and professionally associated herself with Dr Wright, nChain and the entire Satoshi story, so
              it is clear that her evidence was in no way independent. Overall, I agree that Dr Jones’ evidence gave no
              support to Dr Wright’s case, as Lord Grabiner KC appeared to accept when objecting that questioning her
