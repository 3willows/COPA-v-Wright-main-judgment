<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I deal first with that last submission made on
              behalf of Dr Wright, clearly made in his written closing and amplified orally, as I explain below. On the
              pleadings, the position was as follows. In their Particulars of Claim, COPA referred to the GQ interview
              and the ensueing offer by Dr Wright of ‘Extraordinary proof’. Their case is set out in [21]:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘Accordingly, Wright has publicly asserted that one of the ways he can prove he </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>is Satoshi is by referencing his ability to make transactions associated with the </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>Genesis Block and other early Blocks. To date, Wright has failed to do so.’</i></p>
</section>
</blockquote>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_837"><span class="judgment-body__number">837.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his Defence at [34], Dr Wright admitted that
              he had not publicly demonstrated that ability, but he alleged that he had in private demonstrations to
              Messrs Andresen &amp; Matonis (re Blocks 1 and 9), and to Messrs Cellan-Jones and Siegele (re Block 9).
              COPA’s reply put him to proof on these matters.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_838"><span class="judgment-body__number">838.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his oral closing, Lord Grabiner KC submitted
              as follows:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">838.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that it was not open to COPA to run a
                  case that any of the proof sessions was subverted by Dr Wright, on the basis that any such allegation
                  was of fraud or dishonesty which must be clearly pleaded.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">838.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, that, in the absence of a specific
                  plea of dishonesty, it is not open to the Court to make a finding of dishonesty, citing <i>Three
                    Rivers, per </i>Lord Millett at [186].</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">838.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, Counsel for COPA never put a case of
                  subversion to Dr Wright in cross-examination. At most, he said, it was merely suggested to Dr Wright
                  that it would have been feasible to create a malware program and ‘straightforward for someone with Dr
                  Wright’s experience’ to stage the signing session with Mr Andresen {see <b>{Day8/73:22 -74:23}</b>}.
                </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">838.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, for completeness, the issue of
                  subversion was nevertheless addressed in Dr Wright’s written closing.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_839"><span class="judgment-body__number">839.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In response to the challenge, Mr Hough KC made
              COPA’s position very clear. I can summarise it in the following:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Counsel reminded me of an exchange
                  which took place with Dr Wright’s then Counsel, Mr Flynn KC, during the hearing in October 2023
                  following which I gave COPA permission to plead 50 allegations of forgery. In the course of argument
                  Mr Flynn KC made the point that Dr Wright cannot be negligently asserting that he is Satoshi and that
                  ‘<i>Everything he does, on their case, is dishonest’</i>, to which I observed: ‘<i>Yes. They are
                    saying his entire claim to be Satoshi is dishonest</i>.’ ‘<i>And anything supporting or which
                    purports to support that claim is dishonest</i>.’</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel also drew attention to the fact that
                  in my Judgment from that hearing [2023] EWHC 2642 (Ch) at [15] and particularly [54] I acknowledged
                  that ‘<i>the essential feature</i>’ of COPA’s claim was that Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi was
                  fraudulent and, consistently with that, the documents he relies upon in support of that claim have
                  been forged. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, this point proves too much. As Mr
                  Flynn KC observed immediately after the exchange I mentioned above, those points do not take one
                  anywhere because the cases are very clear. Allegations of fraud and dishonesty must be distinctly and
                  properly pleaded. I do not think Mr Hough KC was denying that, he was simply making the point that
                  everyone (including Dr Wright’s legal team) understood what COPA’s case was.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, Counsel referred to the pleaded case
                  that Dr Wright never reliably proved his possession of the private keys and that they put in issue
                  what happened at the signing sessions.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.5.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, Counsel submitted that COPA was not
                  able to plead a positive case about what happened in the signing sessions, because that was outside
                  their knowledge. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.6.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Similarly, in response to the point that it
                  was incumbent on COPA to put to Dr Wright that the signing sessions were subverted in a particular
                  way, for example by saying that he used DNS hijacking or typosquatting or use of malware to interfere
                  with Electrum, Counsel submitted COPA was not able to do that.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.7.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Relatedly, Counsel submitted that what COPA
                  were able to do (and did) was to challenge Dr Wright on his version of what happened at each stage as
                  well as putting to him the ways in which the sessions could have been staged.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">839.8.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Accordingly, Counsel submitted that the
                  finding that COPA seeks (and is entitled to seek) is a finding that Dr Wright did not possess the
                  private keys (e.g. to any of the early blocks, but blocks 1 and 9 in particular) and that the signing
                  sessions did not prove otherwise.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_840"><span class="judgment-body__number">840.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All of this was, in my judgment, a storm in a
              teacup. It was clear that Counsel for COPA did not put allegations to Dr Wright concerning the signing
              sessions which were speculative or for which they did not have material to substantiate them. There is no
              onus on COPA to prove that the signing sessions were subverted by Dr Wright. However, on the pleadings, Dr
              Wright was clearly challenged to prove that the signing sessions did prove that he was in possession of
              the private keys to the ‘early blocks’ and blocks 1 and 9 in particular.</p>
