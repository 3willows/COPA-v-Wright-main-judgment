<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Court may draw adverse inferences from a
                party’s failure to deploy forms of evidence or proof which he/she could reasonably have been expected to
                adduce. Thus, in appropriate cases “<i>a court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the
                  absence or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in
                  the action</i>”, unless a credible reason is given for the witness’s absence: <i>Wisniewski v Central
                  Manchester HA</i> [1998] PIQR P324 at 340. As Lord Leggatt explained in <i>Efobi v Royal Mail Group
                  Ltd </i>[2021] 1 WLR 3863 at §41, this is “<i>a matter of ordinary rationality</i>” and a feature of
                the process of a Court drawing inferences:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>“So far as possible, tribunals should feel free to draw, or to decline to draw, inferences from
                      the facts of the case before them using their common sense without the need to consult law books
                      when doing so. Whether any positive significance should be attached to the fact that a person has
                      not given evidence depends entirely on the context and particular circumstances. Relevant
                      considerations will naturally include such matters as whether the witness was available to give
                      evidence, what relevant evidence it is reasonable to expect that the witness would have been able
                      to give, what other relevant evidence there was bearing on the point(s) on which the witness could
                      potentially have given relevant evidence, and the significance of those points in the context of
                      the case as a whole.”</i></p>
