            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The author of <i>fontspec</i> developed a
              companion package called “<i>unicode-math</i>”. In 2009 it was in its infancy and supported very few fonts
              – and did not support Times New Roman, which was used for the formulae in the Bitcoin White Paper
              {<b>Rosendahl1 [134] {G/7/46}</b>}.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Further, the early versions of
              <i>unicode-math</i> suffered from a load-order problem: when used together with the “<i>amssymb</i>”
              package that defines additional mathematical symbols, the <i>unicode-math</i> package needed to be loaded
              before the <i>amssymb</i> package. Dr Wright’s White Paper LaTeX Files load <i>unicode-math</i>
              <u>after</u> <i>amssymb</i>, meaning that TeX would have issued an error for every one of the 2307
              mathematical symbols defined by the former package {<b>Rosendahl1 [136] {G/7/46</b>}}.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Rosendahl acknowledged in his report that
              these features could <i>in theory </i>have been resolved by working on the source code privately. That was
              seized upon in his cross-examination in which it was suggested that “<i>it would have been technically
                possible in 2008/2009 for Dr Wright to have customised the code to … enable the use of Times New
                Roman</i>” <b>{Day17/30:22-24</b>}. In re-examination, Mr Rosendahl confirmed that this would have taken
              “<i>a matter of weeks, for someone with the technical knowledge</i>” <b>{Day17/35:15-16}</b>.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright has not produced a single document
                  evidencing any private work on the source code for the <i>unicode-math</i> package;</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright lacked the capability to develop
                  any such source code. The Developers reminded me of his evidence that “<i>I know LaTeX. I don't -- I'm
                    not an academic, I don't teach it, so I don't know all the terminology</i>.”
                  <b>{Day15/132:13-14}.</b> There is also no reference to LaTeX in his contemporaneous CVs – an odd
                  omission if he was developing related code at the time. </p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The <i>unicode-math</i> package was in the
                  event only used by Dr Wright with Times New Roman in his so-called White Paper LaTeX Files for one
                  thing: the Greek letter <span style="font-family:Symbol"></span>. {<b>Rosendahl1 [137] {G/7/46}</b>}.
                  The Bitcoin White Paper uses the Times New Roman font in all its formulae, but Dr Wright’s White Paper
                  LaTeX Files wrongly do not: see <b>Rosendahl1 [153-154] {G/7/49}</b>. I agree that it beggars belief
                  that Satoshi Nakamoto would have spent weeks working to revise the <i>unicode-math</i> package for the
                  benefit of using a non-standard font on a single character.</p>
