                      former business partners that created Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Between 2008
                      and before David Kleiman's death in April 2013, the two allegedly worked together on Bitcoin,
                      mining bitcoins and developing blockchain related intellectual property. Starting in 2008 through
                      February 2011, they allegedly worked together as a partnership, and from February 2011 until Mr.
                      Kleiman's death in 2013, they conducted their work through Plaintiff W&amp;K Info Defense Research
                      LLC ("W&amp;K"). During this period, significant amounts of bitcoins allegedly were mined and
                      acquired by Defendant and Mr. Kleiman and valuable intellectual property was developed. This
                      lawsuit concerns a dispute over the ownership of bitcoins and Bitcoin-related intellectual
                      property.</i></p>

                    that Dr Wright was not Satoshi and his claims to be Satoshi were fraudulent. Mr McCormack initially
                    pleaded a defence of truth, but in late 2020, he abandoned that defence. So, whether Dr Wright is or
                    is not Satoshi was not an issue which Chamberlain J. had to determine in his trial Judgment: [2022]
                    EWHC 2058 (QB), 1 August 2022 (“<i>McCormack</i>”). </p>
