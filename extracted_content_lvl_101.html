      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s White Paper LaTeX Files purport to

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright contended that he had compiled the
        Bitcoin White Paper in LuaLaTeX {<b>Wright8 [32-35] {E/23/13}, Wright8 [70-73] {E/23/20</b>}, Wright
        cross-examination <b>{Day5/143-146}</b> and Rosendahl cross-examination <b>{Day17/31:12-13}</b>}. As Mr
        Rosendahl noted, <i>fontspec</i> did not work with LuaLaTeX in March 2009 when Dr Wright had supposedly
        compiled the Bitcoin White Paper from the White Paper LaTeX Files {<b>Rosendahl1 [124] {G/7/43}</b>}.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It would accordingly not have been possible for
        Dr Wright to have used LuaLaTeX at the date of the Bitcoin White Paper, without a custom version of
        <i>fontspec</i> {<b>Rosendahl1 [126] {G/7/44</b>}}. Mr Rosendahl provided a detailed explanation of the
        difficulty that would have been involved in creating such a custom environment at <b>Rosendahl1 [127]
          {G/7/44}</b>.
