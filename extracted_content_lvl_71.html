            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At this point it is appropriate to draw together
              the various allegations which Dr Wright made that various forged documents were planted by Mr Ager-Hanssen
              or some other ‘Bad Actor’. As I understand Dr Wright’s assertions, he makes them on the basis that the
              documents in questions are forgeries, because if they were not, he would continue to rely on them as
              supporting his claim to be Satoshi. So the issue is whether the person responsible for the forgeries in
              question was Dr Wright or some third party or parties, with, presumably, a grudge against him.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I address the allegations of planting by others
              in sections 1, 2, 13, 17, 35 and 40 in the Appendix, but undoubtedly the allegation has the greatest scope
              in section 2 concerning BDOPC.raw. In his oral closing submissions, Counsel for COPA addressed this
              principal allegation, submitting it was both absurd and incredible. He made the following six points:</p>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.1.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, he drew attention to an inconsistency
                  in Dr Wright’s evidence:</p>
                <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">415.1.1.</span>
                  <div>
                    <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright5 [22], [28]-[30]</b>
                      {served 1 December 2023}, his evidence was to the effect that he had simply connected the 2 hard
                      drives to his laptop to check they still worked, but did not access the BDO Drive on the Samsung
                      drive or any files on either hard drive. He mentioned one qualification, in <b>[29]</b> that Stroz
                      Friedberg, on examining the BDO Drive, had identified ‘(i) metadata suggesting that the recycle
                      bin on the Samsung Drive (which sits on the Samsung Drive outside the BDO Drive, which has its own
                      recycle bin) was emptied in September 2023, (ii) the ordering of files added to the recycle bin
                      and (iii) transactional log files within the BDO Drive with a created, modified and access date of
                      17 September 2023’. In <b>[30]</b>, he explained these points by the software systems and
                      processes that he habitually uses which, he said, may have caused the recycle bin on the Samsung
                      Drive to have been automatically emptied when it was connected. He also said it was possible that
                      one of these systems or processes might have opened the BDO Drive automatically, when he checked
                      that the Samsung Drive was working. The import of all of this was to provide reassurance that no
                      material change had occurred to the BDO Drive.</p>

                </section>
                <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">415.1.2.</span>
                  <div>
                    <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel contrasted that account with
                      what Dr Wright said in cross-examination to the effect that, for some inexplicable reason, he had
                      left the BDO Drive connected to his laptop for the days which followed, providing the opportunity
                      for some ‘Bad Actor’ to plant the forged documents on the BDO Drive when hacking into his
                      computer.</p>
                  </div>
                </section>
                <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">415.1.3.</span>
                  <div>
                    <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are a number of reasons why his
                      latter account is implausible. First, it must have been clear to Dr Wright that the provenance and
                      chain of custody in relation to this BDO Drive would be closely scrutinised. This is confirmed by
                      his careful evidence set out in <b>Wright5</b>. Second, leaving the BDO Drive connected would have
                      been a breach of basic security principles, well-known to a professed IT security expert such as
                      Dr Wright. Third, it is inconsistent with his evidence in <b>Wright5</b>.</p>
                  </div>
                </section>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.2.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, Dr Wright’s account presupposes that
                  the ‘Bad Actor’ (whether Mr Ager-Hanssen or one of his associates) was able to identify and taint the
                  71 critical new reliance documents. The alternative explanation, that the Bad Actor created those 71
                  documents themselves and planted them, is highly implausible because Dr Wright would not have
                  recognised them as his, and would not have relied upon them.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.3.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So the Bad Actor had to work out which were
                  the new documents which Dr Wright himself would identify as his new critical reliance documents which,
                  we are told, was done on the basis of a set of bespoke search terms and then careful review of the
                  content. So on this hypothesis, the Bad Actor must have found those documents, identified those that
                  might actually support Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi, and then set to work on them, carrying out a
                  very elaborate set of editing actions to give the impression that those particular documents had been
                  added in mid-September 2023. They would have been working on a drive which contained a huge number of
                  documents, with no guide to help them, because Dr Wright’s account is that between 15 and 20 September
                  2023, he hadn’t gone into the BDO Drive, let alone examine its contents or tell Mr Ager-Hanssen all
                  about the critical reliance documents.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.4.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Counsel for COPA submitted, the Bad
                  Actor’s success would have been quite remarkable, because, on this hypothesis, he/they managed to
                  identify every single new reliance document which was later identified and relied upon by Dr Wright as
                  supporting his claim to be Satoshi.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.5.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, on top of the ingenuity described so
                  far, the Bad Actor had to insert content which was anachronistic to 2007/8, and then edit out that
                  content. They had to seed the BDO Drive with the edited versions. They then had to delete the drive
                  which contained the anachronistic versions, InfoDef09.raw. All that had to have been done in just a
                  few days, but in the hope that Mr Madden would, in due course, (i) be given access to the BDO Drive
                  (something which Dr Wright made efforts to resist) and (ii) be able to recover from the deleted
                  InfoDef09.raw the prior versions of the documents. If Mr Madden had not been able to do those two
                  things, all this work would have been for nothing.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.6.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, the Bad Actor had to have had some
                  documents ready for planting – at least King.rtf and King2.rtf – by 12 September 2023, three days
                  before Dr Wright says he found the Samsung drive in a drawer.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.7.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fifth, the hypothesis assumes that the Bad
                  Actor must have been extremely fortunate: not only did Dr Wright proceed to nominate the documents
                  they had tainted as his new critical reliance documents, but he failed to notice that any of them had
                  been edited. Instead, he studied the documents and provided the instructions to Shoosmiths to create a
                  detailed schedule of the 97 new documents, <b>{P/10/1-7}</b> annexed to <b>Field1</b>.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.8.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Sixth, as Counsel for COPA pointed out,
                  there is no evidence of this alleged hack. Indeed, the principal point said to evidence a hack (see
                  the submission at 410.1 above) is factually incorrect. The images published by Mr Ager-Hanssen were
                  not screenshots, they were photographs of a monitor. Although they are described as screenshots in
                  <b>Wright3 [18]</b>, the exhibit CSW4 clearly contains photographs of what is shown on the screen of a
                  Lenovo laptop <b>{E/3/29-33}</b>. The photograph on p33 shows 3 windows: on top is a Google search for
                  ‘quill 01916 before 2010’ (the text is somewhat difficult to make out); underneath that is a Windows
                  directory window, and the foot of the window shows ‘Assignment-2.doc’ selected; underneath that is a
                  window with some file open from the BDO Drive but with browsing history displayed – again most of the
                  text is unclear but one can see, at the end, ‘the timestamp proves that the data must’ (a phrase in
                  section 3 of the Bitcoin White Paper). On p32, the photograph shows the whole of the Lenovo laptop
                  screen, with the top window being a file search of the term ‘bitcoin’ on the BDO Drive and the second
                  window being the same Google search as p33. On p31, the top window is from an internet browser which
                  has navigated to a page concerning the ‘Quill A4 Planner Pads Meeting Minutes 50lf’.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.9.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for COPA pointed out that these
                  photographs show that Mr Ager-Hanssen was able to take photographs of a screen showing the BDO Drive
                  being accessed and, in some cases, Dr Wright’s browsing history in mid to late September i.e. before
                  Mr Ager-Hanssen turned against Dr Wright and was sacked from nChain. He suggested these photographs
                  were taken at a time when Dr Wright wanted to give Mr Ager-Hanssen access to material to secure his
                  continued support. He pointed out that Dr Wright sent Mr Ager-Hanssen a photograph of a document on
                  screen (subsequently disclosed as a LaTeX file but not the pdf version shown on screen), apparently on
                  5 September, accompanying messages saying ‘the encrypted drive’ ; ‘has everything’; ‘4 million pages’
                  etc. <b>{P/18/11}</b>. The point being that, at this point, Dr Wright was actively collaborating with
                  Mr Ager-Hanssen.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">415.10.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The distinction between a screenshot and a
                  photograph of a screen may appear slight but it is of some significance. The ability to take a
                  screenshot is more consistent with control over the computer itself, whereas the ability to take a
                  photograph of what is shown on the screen is less consistent with control. Further, the sending of a
                  photograph of a screen by Mr Ager-Hanssen is inconsistent with a hack. </p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The only other point I need address from Dr
              Wright’s submissions quoted at paragraph 410 above is the submission that COPA did not challenge Dr
              Wright’s account of being hacked. Counsel for COPA responded by submitting this was a bad point. I agree.
              As Counsel submitted, COPA did not have a positive basis to say what Mr Ager-Hanssen did or did not do,
              but what was put to Dr Wright repeatedly was that he was responsible for the editing and falsifying of the
              BDO materials.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_417"><span class="judgment-body__number">417.</span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The final point to make is that the notion that
              some Bad Actor was responsible for the forgeries of documents on the BDO Drive does not sit well with the
              clear positive evidence (which I address in the next section) that during September 2023, Dr Wright
              himself was creating the LaTeX documents. Indeed, in his answers on Day 5 when being cross-examined about
              two particular LaTeX files – LPA.tex and LP1.tex – Dr Wright asserted that these documents were planted by
              Mr Ager-Hanssen or someone associated with him <b>{Day5/86:14}</b>. I have addressed that assertion in the
              context of the detailed evidence on those two documents in section 17 of the Appendix. That detailed
              evidence demonstrated, as I found in section 17, that these two documents were forgeries, and I am
              entirely satisfied they were forged by Dr Wright himself.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_418"><span class="judgment-body__number">418.</span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, the notion that a Bad Actor was
              responsible for the forgeries on the BDO Drive is literally <i>in</i>credible. It would depend on multiple
              bizarre coincidences, the combination of which is completely implausible.</p>
