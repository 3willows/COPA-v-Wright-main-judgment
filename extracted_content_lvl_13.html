<p><i>Further Disclosure and the Mock Trial</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 25 September 2023, Dr Wright’s solicitors
                wrote to say he had further disclosure to give. It subsequently emerged that Dr Wright claimed to have
                discovered in mid-September 2023 two hard drives which were not previously imaged and which supposedly
                contained more reliable versions of documents supporting his claim.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At this point I introduce nChain, a UK company
                with which Dr Wright had been closely associated (latterly as a consultant) since 2015. The financial
                muscle behind nChain is said to be Mr Calvin Ayre (“<b>Mr Ayre</b>”), a Canadian billionaire, who has
                supported Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi. Until late September 2023, the CEO of nChain was Mr Christen
                Ager-Hanssen (“<b>Mr Ager-Hanssen</b>”).</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although the details only emerged
                subsequently, it turned out that, following service of Madden1, nChain had arranged for Dr Wright to
                undergo a mock trial exercise on 22 September 2023 in which he was cross-examined by a criminal
                barrister, Zafar Ali KC, on a number of his primary reliance documents. A mock judgment, apparently
                given by a judge who had been drafted in to help, was delivered on 24 September 2023, finding Dr
                Wright’s Satoshi claim to be false. The day after the mock trial, Mr Ayre sent Dr Wright an email (which
                Mr Ager-Hanssen posted on X) making clear that Mr Ayre now believed that Dr Wright had forged documents
                and should confess to having done so {see the email of 23 September 2023 at <b>{L19/212/6}</b>. Mr Ayre
                later acknowledged that the email was his. Mr Ayre proposed a narrative covered by his website CoinGeek
                as follows: “<i>We will say that we believe you did forge some documents to replace ones you destroyed
                  earlier to try to pretend you were not Satoshi. We will say this is because your Asperger’s makes you
                  not think and act like an adult…</i>” <b>{L19/212/7}</b>}. The mock trial exercise was revealed by Mr
                Ager-Hanssen, and it has since been admitted by Dr Wright, Mr Matthews and Mr Ali, albeit in differing
                terms {see Wright3 <b>{E/3/1}</b> and Matthews2 <b>{E/27/1}</b>. For Mr Ali’s account, see Clyde &amp;
                Co letter at <b>{M1/1/707}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 29 September 2023, Mr Ager-Hanssen began a
                series of postings on X in which he claimed to have “<i>found compelling evidence that Dr Craig Wright
                  has manipulated documents with the aim to deceive the Court he is Satoshi</i>” <b>{P2/111/44}</b>. Mr
                Ager-Hanssen added that he was “<i>convinced that Dr Craig Wright is NOT Satoshi”. </i>He said that he
                had submitted a whistleblowing report making these points, and also to have raised concerns about
                illegitimate control of the nChain group by Mr Ayre.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Among Mr Ager-Hanssen’s revelations was one
                that Dr Wright had come up with a new hard drive supposedly containing reliable documents. Mr
                Ager-Hanssen alleged that the browsing history showed that Dr Wright had researched topics of
                manipulating files and backdating metadata, and also that he had made searches to discover whether
                Satoshi had compiled any part of his original Bitcoin paper in LaTeX format <b>{L20/195/1}</b>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Following those revelations, I understand that
                Mr Ager-Hanssen was dismissed and left the UK. I was told that interim injunctive relief was obtained to
                prevent further disclosure of allegedly confidential information. He has not played any role in this
                Trial. Thus, he has not had any opportunity to respond to various serious allegations made against him
                by Dr Wright. Furthermore, COPA were anxious to stress that they have had nothing to do with Mr
                Ager-Hanssen, contrary to various conspiracy theories espoused by Dr Wright during his
                cross-examination.</p>
