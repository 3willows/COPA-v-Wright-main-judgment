      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright1</b>, Dr Wright said that he
        manually crafted the Genesis Block rather than mining it and that to ensure that it was timestamped he
        used the headline of an article published in the written UK edition of The Times that day. He says that he
        chose this headline, which referred to the bank bailouts after the 2008 crash, because he strongly
        disagreed with the policy. Dr Wright was not in the UK at this time, but claims to have had access to The
        Times through a university portal. Dr Wright says he uploaded the v0.1 Alpha of Bitcoin on 9 January 2009
        onto SourceForge and at the same time he sent a link to this to the Bitcoin Project’s relevant section on
        the mailing list. </p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As COPA pointed out, Dr Wright strove to provide
        meaning and rationale to all aspects of how Satoshi chose to do certain things but he cited only publicly
        known matters. </p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s account of the Genesis Block in
        <b>Wright1, [107]</b> <b>{E/1/21}</b> and <b>Wright4, [102]</b> <b>{E/4/34}</b> now involves assertions
        that there is neither a public nor a private key linked to it. These assertions were rejected by both
        Professor Meiklejohn and Mr Gao. Professor Meiklejohn was clear that there is a public key for the Genesis
        Block and pointed out that that public key has never spent its content and cannot do so because the
        software does not treat this transaction output as UTXO. On that basis, she said it is not clear if anyone
        knows or has ever known the associate private key {<b>{G/2/46}</b>, <b>[108-109]</b> (paragraphs agreed by
        Mr Gao in the Joint Statement)}. The public key for the Genesis Block is shown at <b>{G/2/22}</b>. I also
        note that Dr Wright’s present account differs from what he told GQ in April 2016, when he claimed that he
        would not sign “<i>every fucking key I own in the world</i>” before adding: “<i>I’ve got the first fucking
          nine keys, I’ve got the fucking genesis bloody block…</i>” <b>{O4/23/4}</b>.

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When confronted with Professor Meiklejohn’s
        evidence in cross-examination <b>{Day7/54:13} - {Day7/57:4}</b>, Dr Wright could only refer to an
        unspecified blog by himself and say that the public key to the Genesis Block (as identified by Prof
        Meiklejohn) is only something that “<i>looks like a public key</i>”. He then claimed that neither of the
        experts in cryptocurrency technology was qualified to opine on the point because they were not
        cryptographers.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_704"><span class="judgment-body__number">704.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright asserted that in the “<i>early
          days</i>” the only individuals involved in mining were himself, and his family (including Don and Max
        Lynam). He said Don and Max Lynam began operating a node from Don’s farm. Concurrently, Dr Wright claimed
        to have been using his own mining set up in ‘69 racks’ at his Australian residence, with 3 other laptops
        and 4 desktop systems in another location at Tumbi Umbi {<b>Wright 1, [116]</b> <b>{E/1/22}</b>}. He
        claimed that the considerable electricity associated with mining amounted to thousands of dollars, but
        that he was willing to go to this expense to set the Bitcoin Blockchain in motion. As Professor Meiklejohn
        explained, mining at that time would not have entailed such a cost. Dr Wright went on to say that his
        motivations in those days (2009-10) were primarily driven by a desire to implement the technology and not
        the pursuit of financial gain {<b>Wright1, [121]</b> <b>{E/1/23}</b>}. That conflicts with the position he
        now takes, having issued claims which seek in effect total control of Bitcoin under a range of different
        IP rights.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am satisfied that Dr Wright’s evidence about
        launching the Bitcoin system was pure fantasy. Furthermore, his account of mining Bitcoin in the early
        days does not ring true.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Point (vii) is ridiculous, not least because
        there was no expert or any other evidence to support it. On point (vi), I have rejected Mr Jenkins’
        evidence that he was shown a ‘Timecoin’ paper in 2009/2010. On point (iv), I have explained above why that
        incident suggests that Dr Wright is not Satoshi. The remaining points, even if I assume they are true, are
        similar to those I dealt with above, in that it is relatively easy, with the benefit of 20:20 hindsight,
        to reach back to pluck out some feature which might have some relation to Bitcoin. They are all
        generalised assertions.</p>
