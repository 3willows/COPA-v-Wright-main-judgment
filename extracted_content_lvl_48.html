<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As is often said in the Patent field, it is the
              <i>reasons</i> which an expert gives for holding an opinion which matter, not so much the fact s/he has
              expressed the opinion. In this case, I am very grateful to all the experts who have provided expert
              evidence. They more than sufficiently educated me so that I was able to make all necessary findings in
              this Judgment and Appendix.</p>
