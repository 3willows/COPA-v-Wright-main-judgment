                                                also addressed the declaration which would arise out of my formulation

                                                that Dr Wright is or is not Satoshi Nakamoto. I understood him to submit

                                the first
                                point to note is that this case has changed somewhat since it was first pleaded. In
                                particular, this Trial
                                of the Identity Issue has been the trial of a preliminary issue in the BTC Core Claim
                                where the Developers
                                and various members of COPA are sued by Dr Wright and two of his companies for
                                infringement of copyright
                                in the Bitcoin White Paper – the key point being that a copy of the Bitcoin White Paper
                                is in the Bitcoin
                                Blockchain, which, as I understand matters, is reproduced by every node. Furthermore, it
                                is appropriate to
                                keep in mind that in the BTC Core claim, Dr Wright is claiming database right in various
                                manifestations of
                                the Bitcoin Blockchain and, furthermore, the Kraken and Coinbase Defendants (to the
                                passing off claims
                                made against them in those actions) have agreed to be bound by the outcome of this
                                Trial, those actions
                                being stayed in the meantime. In mentioning these matters I am not changing the issue
                                which is the subject
                                of this Trial. The debate here is over what declarations would have utility in the
                                circumstances which now
                                present themselves. In this regard, Mr Hough KC for COPA also reminded me of the various
                                claims for
                                defamation which Dr Wright has brought against various people who have said or implied
                                he is not Satoshi.

                                (in the event that I so concluded) somewhat surprising, bearing in mind the huge effort
