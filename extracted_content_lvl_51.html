<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b>Madden1</b> was a very substantial report
                  (amounting with Appendices to around 970 pages) served on 1<sup> </sup>September 2023. It addressed Dr
                  Wright’s initial list of 107 Reliance Documents.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b>Madden2</b> (17 November 2023) was
                  supposed to be his report in reply to Dr Placks’ report of 23 October 2023 (which focussed on the 48
                  Reliance Documents analysed in <b>Madden1</b>, and certain extra MYOB files, but not other documents
                  analysed in <b>Madden1</b>). As Mr Madden says, he was provided with a significant amount of new
                  documents when he was preparing it and he analysed these.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b>Madden3</b> (7 December 2023) contained
                  his preliminary analysis of certain aspects of the 97 Additional Documents, the BDO Image and the
                  question of whether the Bitcoin White Paper was created using LaTeX or not. This was done for the
                  purposes of the PTR. He detected that the BDO Image had been manipulated, which included the use of
                  clock manipulation and metadata editing. He observed that the vast majority of the 97 documents were
                  in formats with little or no metadata for forensic analysis, and made the point very clearly that any
                  proper analysis would require access to a forensic image of the drive from which the BDO Image was
                  taken. Of the minority of files which provided information which could be analysed forensically, he
                  found that several bore strong indications of metadata tampering and backdating.</p>

                  served in the middle of the Trial) addressed the new documents which I permitted Dr Wright to adduce
                  at the start of the Trial, as well as some of the opinion evidence in Wright 11. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Madden’s evidence underpins almost all of
              COPA’s allegations of forgery. In their Closing Submissions, Counsel for Dr Wright attacked Mr Madden’s
              evidence, his qualifications and his independence. These were developed in Lord Grabiner KC’s oral closing
              and led to his submission, (which he accepted was a fairly drastic conclusion) that the safest course for
              me to take would be to disregard Mr Madden’s evidence ‘<i>because of the serious doubts about his
                independence’</i>.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_298"><span class="judgment-body__number">298.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This was a bold submission to make in view of
              the fact that Dr Wright’s experts (Dr Placks &amp; Mr Lynch) had agreed with most of Mr Madden’s findings
              in his first to fourth reports, but it was at least consistent with the position taken in
              cross-examination by Dr Wright where he dismissed all the expert evidence on the basis that none of the
              experts were properly qualified, the sub-text being that only Dr Wright was.</p>
