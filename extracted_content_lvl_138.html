<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If Dr Wright were Satoshi Nakamoto then he ought
              to have been able to sign a message using the PGP key associated with Satoshi Nakamoto that was on the
              bitcoin.org website. It can be seen at <b>{H/318/2}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The relevance of the key arises in two ways:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">775.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, in his initial list of requests for
                  proof on 29 March 2016 <b>{L11/449.1/1}</b>, Gavin Andresen requested that Dr Wright sign a message
                  with that key. In the Kleiman proceedings Mr Andresen vaguely recalled a conversation with Dr Wright
                  about PGP signatures in which Dr Wright “<i>gave some reason why he either did not have the key, or it
                    would not be good proof</i>” <b>{{E/17/42} at lines 11-14</b>}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, in the backlash following Dr
                  Wright’s failed blogpost on 2 May 2016 (on which see below), efforts were made to get Dr Wright to
                  sign using that key. Dr Wright sought to fob off those requests on the basis of an absence of relevant
                  key slices: <b>{L13/297}, {L13/299}, {L13/304}, {L13/307}, {L13/308}, {L13/310} </b>and<b>
                    {L13/313}</b>. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In their Particulars of Claim, COPA pointed out
              that Dr Wright ought to be able to show that he had control over Satoshi’s private key. In his Defence, Dr
              Wright addressed the PGP key in question as follows {<b>Defence [83(2)] {A/3/24} and Wright4 [104]
                {E/4/34}</b>}. </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>There has been a public discussion of a
                    key created in 2011 after Dr Wright “retired” his Satoshi Nakamoto persona. The key was created by a
                    person or persons unknown. Therefore, control, command or ownership of that key has no probative
                    value as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.</i>”</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright had said almost exactly the same thing
              in an interview in 2021 {available in the webarchive, plus a transcript is at <b>{O4/14/36}</b>}, in which
              he directed the interviewer to a 2009 archive version of the bitcoin.org website, asked the interviewer to
              scroll down to and then click on the PGP key link (which takes the reader to a 28 February 2011 archive)
              before resolutely announcing: “<i>The first version was after I left</i>” <b>{O4/14/36}</b> and then
              continuing <b>{O4/14/37}</b>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><i>“RYAN CHARLES: So in fact when I look at what the URL is, it says if people can see on my screen,
                    2009, but then when you click it, the 2009 one is not there and it is a 2011 version instead. </i>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>DR. CRAIG WRIGHT: Yes. </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>RYAN CHARLES: So it does seem like the lack of version there could indicate that there was a
                    different version at this time that has been excluded. </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>DR. CRAIG WRIGHT: Yes. A different version has been ---- </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>RYAN CHARLES: Just to be clear then, are you saying you did that or did they do that? </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>DR. CRAIG WRIGHT: I did not do that. I was not in control of the web page at this point.”</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright sought to distance himself from this
              in evasive answers in cross-examination at <b>{Day8/37:9} </b>to<b> {Day8/40:7} </b>and at<b>
                {Day8/42:2-24</b>}.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_779"><span class="judgment-body__number">779.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So the issue is whether Dr Wright’s suggestion
              that the PGP key was “<i>created by a person or persons unknown</i>” “<i>in 2011</i>” is true or false. On
              this, the Developers relied on two points: first, the date of creation of the key and second, the nature
              of the key. </p>
