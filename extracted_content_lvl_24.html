<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Dr Wright’s written Closing, my attention
                was drawn to the following legal principles regarding the preparation of expert evidence:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">121.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <i>Imperial Chemical Industries Limited
                      v Merit Merrell Technology Limited</i> [2018] EWHC 1577, at [237], Fraser J reiterated that:
                    “<i>The principles that govern expert evidence must be carefully adhered to, both by the experts
                      themselves, and the legal advisers who instruct them</i>.” He went on to set out examples of the
                    application of the well-known principles in <i>The Ikarian Reefer</i> [1993] 2 Lloyds LR 68, the
                    first being that “<i>expert evidence presented to the Court should be, and </i><i><u>should be seen
                        to be</u></i><i>, the independent product of the expert uninfluenced as to form or content by
                      the exigencies of litigation (Whitehouse v Jordan [1981] 1 WLR 246 at 256, per Lord
                      Wilberforce)</i>” (emphasis added), the second being that an expert should provide, to the court,
                    independent assistance by way of “<i>objective, unbiased opinion</i>” as to matters in his area of
                    expertise. This duty is echoed in paragraph 2.1 and 2.2 of Practice Direction 35: </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Expert evidence should be the
                          independent product of the expert uninfluenced by the pressures of litigation.</i></p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><b><i>2.2</i></b></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Experts should assist the court by
                          providing objective, unbiased opinions on matters within their expertise, and should not
                          assume the role of an advocate.”</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As stated by the editors of <i>Phipson on
                      Evidence</i>, at 33-29: “In some cases the expert expresses his views to the lawyer who prepares
                    the first draft or outline of the report for the expert to review. Whilst this can be permissible if
                    properly done, in most cases this should be avoided as it runs the risk that the expert’s views may
                    become influenced by the lawyer’s own views.” </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If an expert’s report is found not to be
                    compliant with the principles of independence or impartiality, there are a wide variety of sanctions
                    available to the court. Typically, the court will either refuse to admit the evidence of the expert,
                    or, more frequently, the matter will be taken into account when considering the weight to attach to
                    that expert’s evidence.<i> </i>{<i>Expert Evidence: Law and Practice</i>, 9-013; <i>Phipson on

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Since expert evidence is usually the main and
                sometimes the only evidence in Patent trials, I was already very familiar with these principles. Whether
                they were observed in this case is a topic to which I return below.</p>
