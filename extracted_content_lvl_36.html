<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright11, [269-297]</b>, Dr Wright set out
        an elaborate story which included him having received emails from Denis Mayaka on 10 and 29 September
        2023. Mr Mayaka was a company formation agent who was involved in Dr Wright’s acquisition of Tulip Trading
        Limited as a company incorporated in the Seychelles. Dr Wright claimed that Mr Mayaka had used, not his
        professional email address, but a Gmail one: <span style="color:initial"><u>papa.neema@gmail</u></span><span style="color:initial"><u>.com</u></span>. Dr
        Wright said that, on 10 September 2023, “Papa Neema” sent files said to be tied to Dr Wright’s companies
        in 2009 to 2012 <b>{CSW/25/1}</b>. These included alleged invoices from Abacus Seychelles and a version of
        the “Timecoin” paper (which I address in the next section). He also said that “Papa Neema” separately sent
        photographs of a computer monitor with images of the invoices on them.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are a series of indications that these
        emails were sent by Dr Wright to himself, as further detailed in <b>Madden5</b>, from [87] onwards
        <b>{G/9/29}</b>.
      </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">155.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, the time zone setting of the emails
            (both those dated 10 and those dated 29 September) was +0100, which was consistent with the UK but not
            with Mr Mayaka’s residence (Nairobi, Kenya +0300). Faced with that inconvenient fact, Dr Wright
            claimed that Mr Mayaka set his computer clock to London time because he worked with British clients. I
            agree with COPA that was an obvious lie: it makes no sense for someone to do that <b>{Day15/49:23} -
              {Day15/50:17}</b>.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">155.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, there are a series of dubious
            features to the Timecoin document supposedly sent by Papa Neema, including the fact that Papa Neema
            just happened to send it to Dr Wright five days before he found the Samsung Drive containing a
            hash-identical copy of this previously “lost” document.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">155.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thirdly, there were further suspicious
            features associated with the Abacus invoices, including the fact that four documents created on
            different dates across two years (with different templates) had file titles with the same spelling
            mistake (“Invoive” for “Invoice”). </p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">155.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourthly, there are a series of indications
            that the computer monitor screen on the photographs sent by “Papa Neema” was Dr Wright’s, including
            that the tabs shown referenced his documents (at least one from the BDO Drive) and his favoured
            software products.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_156"><span class="judgment-body__number">156.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am well aware that COPA did not include the
        Papa Neema emails in their supplemental Schedules of Dr Wright’s forgeries, although Mr Sherrell’s
        Twentieth Witness Statement set out in detail COPA’s reasons for alleging they were. COPA faced a
        constantly moving target of forged documents produced by Dr Wright which continued up to the start of
        trial and, indeed, during it. COPA made their position very clear and Dr Wright was given every
        opportunity to rebut their allegations. Accordingly, I do not consider that I am disqualified from making
        findings on these emails and their contents.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_157"><span class="judgment-body__number">157.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For all the reasons set out in <b>Madden5</b> in
        his analysis of the Papa Neema emails, I find they were not genuine and were sent by Dr Wright to himself.
