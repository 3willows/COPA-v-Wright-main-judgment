                                faced some difficulties which I concluded it was not appropriate to decide on that

                                say that the case on these documents has been going downhill ever since Field1 and

                                explanation which seeks
                                to contend that, from the wreckage of what remains from the high point of the evidence
                                in <b>Field1</b>
                                and <b>Wright6</b>, Dr Wright still has a point. It is not necessary to set out all of
                                this convoluted
                                explanation. It is adequately summarised in the proposition at sub-paragraph 422.1
                                above. The second part
                                seeks to persuade me of the very fine point which remains which is that because Mr
                                Rosendahl gave evidence
                                that the Bitcoin White Paper <i>could</i> have been produced using LaTeX, I cannot
                                safely reach the
                                conclusion that LaTeX was not used in the creation of the Bitcoin White Paper.</p>

                                can be given to this point. However, it would be remiss of me to leave out of account
                                the whole LaTeX
                                story, because the story provides a prime example of what became a familiar sequence:
                                (a) Dr Wright
                                produces documents in respect of which it is suggested, either implicitly or explicitly
                                (and as regards
                                the LaTeX files, with <i>certainty</i>), that they prove he is Satoshi; (b) analysis of
                                the documents
                                suggests they cannot pre-date the Bitcoin White Paper; whereupon (c) Dr Wright maintains
                                they are genuine
                                but his story changes; and (d) when seeking to maintain his position under
                                cross-examination, the story
                                changes further and can only be supported by yet further lies from Dr Wright.</p>
