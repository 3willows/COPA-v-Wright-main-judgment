<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the basis of all of the above, Counsel for
        the Developers submitted that Dr Wright’s attempt to replicate the Bitcoin White Paper, oblivious to the
        fact that his activity was being recorded by Overleaf, his misunderstanding of the metadata of the Bitcoin
        White Paper, his reverse-engineering of the images using Aspose and his inability even to limit himself to
        contemporaneous LaTeX packages and commands make his claim to have compiled the Bitcoin White Paper in
        LaTeX seem laughable.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Counsel also submitted, this is no laughing
        matter. The end-product of Dr Wright’s activity in Overleaf was presented to the Court at the PTR as being
        capable of producing an “<i>exact replica</i>” of the Bitcoin White Paper. It was said to “<i>uniquely
          code</i>” for the Bitcoin White Paper and to contain Dr Wright’s “<i>digital watermark</i>”. All of that
        was untrue. The basis for Dr Wright’s application to the Court on 1 December 2023 was a lie. I agree that
        his application was a fraud on the Court and a fraud on COPA and the Developers, bearing in mind that the
        possible consequences of this application included an adjournment of the trial, possibly for a year and a
        potential loss of counsel team for COPA.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Moreover, Counsel submitted that Dr Wright’s
        incompetent and dishonest account of the production of the Bitcoin White Paper shows that Dr Wright does
        not know how the Bitcoin White Paper was produced. It shows that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto. I can only
        agree.</p>
