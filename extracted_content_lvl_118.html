            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I mentioned above, in their Closing
              Submissions, the Developers drew together a number of points which cast doubt on Dr Wright’s proficiency
              in C++, and I consider these points here. As the Developers pointed out, there was little support for Dr
              Wright’s supposed expertise in C++ in documents which can be reliably dated to 2008-2009. The section of
              his BDO CV which referred to ‘computing skills’ referred only to experience of ‘C programming and Code
              audit’ not C++. When he applied to Microsoft for a job in January 2008, he was asked ‘<i>Can you code (and
                do you want to)? What programming languages are you most proficient with?</i>’ ‘<i>Please describe your
                experience writing code (incl. SQL queries) over the past 5 years</i>’, and ‘<i>Which programming
                languages can you read, but not write</i>’ to which he answered:</p>

                <p><i>I have programmed in Java, though I prefer C (pure C, not even object). I used to be a C coder -
                    way back - but I never was good at the graphics. I am not an artist and I never really liked high
                    level languages for coding. </i></p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His decompiling experience is consistent with
              his role as an auditor and with malware research/analysis, looking at the decompiled code to see what the
              malware is trying to do, but decompiling is not coding. Bearing in mind Mr Andresen’s evidence (in his
              Kleiman deposition {E/17/211}) that in his view Satoshi was in the top 10% of all programmers he had
              encountered (in the context of questions about Satoshi’s actual source code written in C++), it is highly
              unlikely that Satoshi would have described himself as an <i>occasional</i> user of C++ in January 2008.

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers also point to Mr Hinnant’s
              evidence in response to Dr Wright’s claims about &lt;chrono&gt; (and the sleep_for function),
              &lt;thread&gt; and &lt;random&gt;, in that Mr Hinnant’s evidence suggested a lack of real expertise in C++
              on Dr Wright’s part. They also point out that Satoshi did not use Dr Wright’s ‘sleep_for’ function in the
              Bitcoin code, instead using the basic Sleep function from the Windows API, via inclusion of the headers.h
              file, which in turn included windows.h.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers went on to cite three points
              which they submitted showed that Dr Wright cannot have written the Bitcoin Source Code:</p>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">644.1.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, his inability to describe the concept
                  of an unsigned integer.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">644.2.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, his misunderstanding of the basic
                  CheckBlock function in the code.</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
                  style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">644.3.</span></span>
              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, his lack of knowledge regarding the
                  proof-of-work function in the Bitcoin code which is said to have emerged in the approach taken in the
                  cross-examination of Dr Back.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for Dr Wright objected to any reliance
              being placed on these points because (a) COPA had made it clear at an earlier hearing that they had not
              pleaded and were not advancing any case that Dr Wright misunderstood the technology of Bitcoin and (b) the
              Developers had not pleaded these points. They also submitted they should be given little, if any, weight.
              Notwithstanding that, they sought to downplay the challenge on the unsigned integer issue. The second and
              third points are somewhat related. I consider the second point in this section and what weight to give to
              it. The third point is closely bound up with the specific challenges made to Dr Back’s evidence in
              cross-examination and addressed in some detail in Dr Wright’s written closing.</p>

        <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_646"><span class="judgment-body__number">646.</span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have considered Counsel’s objection carefully,
              but I concluded that I should consider and take account of these points for several reasons: (i) partly
              due to Dr Wright’s persistent boasting of his abilities; (ii) partly also because of Dr Wright’s very
              extensive reply statement in Wright11 in which he raised all sorts of new points; (iii) perhaps most
              importantly, because he says he is Satoshi. Satoshi would be able to deal with these points. Finally,
              these points sit at a different level to the disputes over the technology of Bitcoin, as exemplified in Mr
              Gao’s report.</p>
