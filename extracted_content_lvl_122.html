              shows that the prompt for Satoshi Nakamoto’s approach to Wei Dai, was Wei Dai’s b-money page, rather than
              something else. Second, the effect of inserting a reference to Wei Dai’s b-money page as the first
              reference in the Bitcoin White Paper would have been to lead to Dr Back’s paper becoming the sixth
              reference – as in fact it was in the version published by Satoshi in October 2008: <b>{L3/231/8}</b>.
              Thus, it is clear that there was no reference in the Bitcoin White Paper to Wei Dai’s b-money page until
              it was mentioned to Satoshi by Adam Back.</p>

                    that code is in my open source Crypto++ library, and he probably just downloaded and used it without

              <b>Wright11 [370] {CSW/1/69}</b>, Dr Wright further tried to suggest that he had been aware of Wei Dai’s
              b-money <u>proposal</u> prior to his dealings with Dr Back, but was not aware of Wei Dai’s b-money
              <u>page</u>. That might seem an odd point of detail for Dr Wright to persist with in light of the
              exchanges with Dr Back and Wei Dai I have already described. However, Dr Wright was compelled to argue the
              point because of prior publications by him asserting longstanding familiarity with Wei Dai’s work. </p>
