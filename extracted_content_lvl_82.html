<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The preceding account of Dr Wright’s activity on
              his Overleaf account has only emerged as a result of documents and information provided by Shoosmiths

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright had numerous opportunities to tell the
              truth – that the so-called Bitcoin White Paper LaTeX Files were the product of days of work done on
              Overleaf in November 2023 and not the processes described in his first and fourth witness statements but
              he failed to take them: </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He said nothing to that effect when asking

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Nor did he provide any such description
                  when, on 20 December 2023, he served Wright8, a 24-page statement in which he purported to provide
                  details of his LaTeX environment. <b>{E/23}.</b></p>

                  January 2024, when he served his reply evidence, <b>Wright11</b>. Shoosmiths’ letter of 13 December
                  2023 stated that this statement would give Dr Wright’s account of “<i>the corrections he has made to
                    the White Paper LaTeX files since the first publication of the Bitcoin White Paper, to the best of
                    his recollection given the passage of time</i>”. His witness statement gave no such account. In
                  truth, there had been no “corrections” to the files, and the passage of time (less than two months)
                  was unlikely to have clouded Dr Wright’s recollection.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As an aside, Dr Wright did make reference to how
              the files had been stored on the QNAP server in <b>Wright14</b>. At one point it seemed that Dr Wright
              might place some emphasis on this server as a repository of relevant information. In <b>Wright14 at
                {E/33/4}</b> Dr Wright explained how Alix Partners came to copy the QNAP server and took it away. Dr
              Wright suggests that he copied the White Paper LaTeX Files onto an external drive from the QNAP server at
              that time. I agree that suggestion cannot be true. AlixPartners have confirmed that they collected the
              QNAP server on 4-5 February 2019: see Shoosmiths’ letter of 29 January 2024 at <b>{M1/2/138}</b>.
              AlixPartners inspected the QNAP server onsite, detected it was encrypted and took it away
              <b>{M1/2/139}</b>. They did not seek to image the QNAP server because it was encrypted, as Dr Wright has
              confirmed <b>{M1/2/140}</b>. Given that the QNAP server was “<i>not accessible to them without valid
                credentials and keys</i>” and “<i>inaccessible whether by AlixPartners, [Dr Wright] or a third
                party</i>” <b>{M1/2/140}</b>, Dr Wright cannot have accessed it to remove the White Paper LaTeX Files.
              In Tulip Trading, Dr Wright has suggested that the QNAP server is not even owned by him, but is instead
              owned by nChain <b>{S1/1.36/2} at [5]</b> and so the QNAP server faded from attention in the present
              proceedings.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By January 2024 no metadata had been
                  provided – and Dr Wright had not even provided Shoosmiths with the login credentials to his Overleaf

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Accordingly, COPA wrote to Overleaf directly
                  on 3 January 2024. Overleaf responded to say that they had provided information to Shoosmiths, and
                  separately wrote to Shoosmiths directing them to the Project History feature on Dr Wright’s Overleaf

                  files said to have been provided by Dr Wright to demonstrate Overleaf’s “Other logs and files”

                  January 2024 requesting that they produce the relevant files. That same day, Shoosmiths wrote to
                  advise that Overleaf had emailed to Dr Wright “<i>an export of the project history</i>” for his
                  account. In the event, Overleaf declined to provide information to the Developers.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Faced with the imminent start of trial, the
                  Developers made an application for Dr Wright to be ordered to consent to Overleaf providing the data
                  from his account on 16 January 2024. That application prompted Shoosmiths to confirm that they would
                  be “<i>in a position to provide the materials requested</i>” on 22 January 2024. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 22 January 2024, Shoosmiths finally produced
              four zip files, including one containing a redacted version of the data that had been supplied by
              Overleaf. Even now it is not clear who had decided on the relevant redactions or why. The files included:

                  related to the Maths (OLD) folder, the existence of which had not previously been revealed. The file
                  showed that Dr Wright had carried material from the Maths (OLD) project into the (disclosed) main.tex

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 1 February 2024, after being pressed further
              in correspondence, Shoosmiths wrote to Macfarlanes about the Maths (OLD) project. They confirmed that Dr
              Wright had put the REDACTED_project.json file associated with the Maths (OLD) project into the Bitcoin
              folder that had been disclosed to COPA and the Developers “<i>inadvertently</i>”. As Counsel submitted,
              put another way, Dr Wright had never intended to reveal the existence of the Maths (OLD) project to the
              Developers.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_462"><span class="judgment-body__number">462.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, the materials disclosed from the Maths
              (OLD) project were a revelation. They showed for the first time details of Dr Wright’s repeated tinkering
              with the White Paper LaTeX files between 17 and 19 November. Nevertheless, the Maths (OLD) files were
              defective in two respects:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">462.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Dr Wright was continuing to assert
                  privilege over some of the files: including the ZZZ and Test subfolder into which Dr Wright had first
                  placed the BitcoinSN.tex file {see <b>{M1/2/153} at [2.d]}</b>;</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, the changes to the White Paper LaTeX
                  files were shown in a Maths (OLD)_chunks spreadsheet rather than in their native chunks.json format.
                  As a result (although it was possible to track most of the changes on a row-by-row basis from the
                  spreadsheet) it was impossible to rebuild and compile the changes sequentially from the available
                  data.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On Day 5 of the trial, Mr Hough KC turned to the
              topic of the White Paper LaTeX Files in his first cross-examination of Dr Wright. In particular, he took
              Dr Wright to the chart set out at paragraph 455 above and suggested that Dr Wright was responsible for the
              edits shown in that document. Dr Wright admitted that he was, but then said that he had made all of the
              changes during demonstrations to Shoosmiths:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although Dr Wright’s Counsel then observed that
              issues of privilege were being traversed, Dr Wright’s answers put Shoosmiths in an impossible position. I
              agree that it plainly was not true that Dr Wright had made the changes in demonstrations to Shoosmiths.
              Indeed, as noted at paragraphs 453 to 454 above, he had not even mentioned any changes in his emails to
              Shoosmiths enclosing the Bitcoin folder.</p>

              2024. For the first time, unredacted chunks.json files were produced by Dr Wright. That enabled the
              Developers to set about compiling each of the revisions that Dr Wright had made to the White Paper LaTeX
              Files between 17 November 2023 and 24 November 2023. The Developers presented that work to Shoosmiths on
              Monday 19 February 2024, together with the code that they had developed to compile the documents from the
