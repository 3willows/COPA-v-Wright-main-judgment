            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright's period at BDO from 2004 to 2008 is
              the time when his story really begins to describe him planning out the Bitcoin system. He claims that his
              education by Allan Granger (a BDO partner) in triple-entry accounting played a pivotal role in Bitcoin. Dr
              Wright says that, in 2007, he introduced Mr Granger to what would become Bitcoin, though without that
              name. He also claims he discussed Bitcoin with Neville Sinclair. He has said on other occasions that he
              tried to interest BDO in investing in his nascent cryptocurrency project.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his evidence in the <i>Granath</i> case, Mr
              Sinclair said that he had no recollection of discussing a prospective electronic cash system with Dr
              Wright while they worked together. Dr Wright has never had any supportive evidence from Mr Granger or the
              other two supposed attendees at BDO meetings. Dr Wright has repeatedly relied upon a set of BDO minutes of
              one meeting to back up this story (“the Handwritten BDO Minutes”), but I have found the manuscript minutes
              are a forgery (see Section 9 in the Appendix).</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s time at BDO also raises the point
              (see 5(d) above) about his proposal made to Mr Matthews at Centrebet. The only document purporting to
              support the claim is a supposed pitch document (not taken forward) <b>{L5/48}</b> which was found by Mr
              Madden to be unreliable <b>{Day11/88:25} - {Day11/89:17}; {Day11:107:8}</b>. In view of my finding as to
              Mr Matthews’ credibility, I dismiss the suggestion that this alleged proposal was a founding part of
              Bitcoin.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">More generally, it can be seen that the points
              relied on in paragraph 5 quoted above are put no higher than being ‘<i>relevant or related to the
                technology and concepts underpinning Bitcoin’</i>. Even taking these points at face value (i.e. assuming
              there is no exaggeration in them), I observe that, with the benefit of 20:20 hindsight, it is relatively
              easy to reach back into prior projects to pick out elements which <i>might</i> have something to do with
              what was utilised in either the Bitcoin White Paper or the Bitcoin system. These points therefore carry
              very little weight on their own. Furthermore, when viewed against the evidence of forgery pointing in the
              other direction, they are nothing more than unsupported assertion, from unreliable witnesses. </p>

              the submissions in Section IV of Dr Wright’s Closing. I refer to my conclusion above that the Bitcoin
              White Paper was drafted in OpenOffice 2.4. There is no evidence that it was drafted using LaTeX. It is
              likely that the first time that the content of the Bitcoin White Paper encountered LaTeX was in September
              2023 when Dr Wright set about trying to create a forgery or forgeries which he thought (mistakenly) would
              not suffer from having metadata which would reveal it or them to be forged.</p>
