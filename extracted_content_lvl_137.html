            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is apparent that in the development of his
              account to be Satoshi, Dr Wright has largely based it on known facts about Satoshi’s work and
              communications. However, there are instances where Dr Wright’s deductions about what he thinks happened
              have turned out to be wrong and some concern his assertions about transfers of Bitcoin.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In a fiery interview with GQ magazine conducted
              by Stuart McGurk with Dr Nicholas Courtois, Dr Wright asserted that he (as Satoshi) had only transferred
              bitcoins to Hal Finney and Zooko “<i>full stop</i>” <b>{{L14/67/1} at 5:17-5:21</b>}. Notwithstanding what
              Mr Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn had said in his witness statement that he never received any bitcoin from Satoshi,
              in his cross-examination on Day 7 Dr Wright again asserted that Satoshi had transferred bitcoins to Zooko:

              Wilcox-O’Hearn as a witness above. His evidence in cross-examination on Day 14 on the matter of whether
              Satoshi had transferred bitcoins to him was as follows. Backed up by the detail in his witness statement,
              I found his evidence entirely credible:</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This was not the only error in Dr Wright’s prior
              assertions about Satoshi Nakamoto’s transfer of bitcoins. Satoshi made transfers of Bitcoin to Nicholas
              Bohm, a former partner of Norton Rose who had developed an interest in cryptography {<b>Bohm1 [5]
                {C/10/2}</b> and <b>Bohm1 [15] {C/10/4}</b>}. Satoshi would have known of those transfers, but it would
              seem that Dr Wright only became aware of Mr Bohm’s dealings with Satoshi when COPA served Mr Bohm’s
              witness statement in these proceedings. When challenged on this point on Day 7, his answer presented a
              very striking contrast with the definitive statement in the GQ interview (to Hal Finney and Zooko “<i>full
                stop</i>”)”</p>
