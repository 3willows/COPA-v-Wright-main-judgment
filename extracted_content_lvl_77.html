<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 27 November 2023, Shoosmiths wrote to COPA
              and the Developers (a) to reveal the existence of the White Paper LaTeX Files, said for the first time to
              be stored on Overleaf, (b) to seek to impose stringent limitations on their disclosure and (c) asking to

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Neither COPA nor the Developers were prepared to
              accede to the proposals made by Dr Wright and so, on 1 December 2023, an application was made by Dr Wright
              for permission to rely on the so-called White Paper LaTeX Files (and other documents), for an adjournment
              of the trial and for revised directions to that adjourned trial. I heard and determined that application
              at the PTR. </p>

                  Wright’s Overleaf account had not previously been reviewed for disclosure by Ontier because they were
