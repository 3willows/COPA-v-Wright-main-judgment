<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 19 November 2023 at 18:23 Dr Wright created a
              new project, ‘Bitcoin’. Around one minute later he copied the content of the final version of the
              BitcoinSN.tex file from the Maths (OLD) folder into the main.tex file of the ‘Bitcoin’ project, i.e. the
              main document path of the so-called White Paper LaTeX Files <b>{L21/14.1/44}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright spent several hours making changes to
              the main.tex file in the morning of 20 November 2023. He then held further demonstrations with Shoosmiths
              between 15:00-15:30 and 16:30-17:00 {Shoosmiths’ letter of 16 February 2024 <b>{M/3/15} at [8.b-8.c]</b>}.
              Only four inconsequential changes were made during those demonstrations; and then only in the latter
              session i.e. no changes are shown between 15:00-15:30 at <b>{L21/14.1/238}-{L21/14.1/239}</b>; four
              changes were made between 16:30-17-00 at <b>{L21/14.1/244}-{L21/14.1/245}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright sent downloads from Overleaf to
              Shoosmiths (including various compilations) on 20 November 2023 at 15:54, 16:22 and 16:57. Those downloads
              and the associated compilations were not produced to COPA and the Developers until 16 February 2024 (after
              the conclusion of Dr Wright’s first cross-examination) {Shoosmiths’ letter of 16 February 2024
              <b>{M/3/15}</b>}. The covering emails <b>{{L20/252.86}, {L20/252.87}</b> and <b>{L20/252.88}</b>} made no
              reference to Dr Wright having made any changes, or to him planning to do so.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright continued to make changes to the
              main.tex file between 20 November and 24 November 2023. He then downloaded and sent the ‘Bitcoin’ folder
              to Shoosmiths at 17:20. The covering email again made no reference to any changes that Dr Wright might
              have made – and described main.tex as “<i>the one Ppl know</i>”<b>{L20/252.89}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright then went on to make yet further
              changes to the main.tex file. His activity on main.tex is illustrated below and at <b>{M1/2/103}</b>.</p>
