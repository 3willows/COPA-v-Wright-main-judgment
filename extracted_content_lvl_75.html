      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This section is largely based on a section from
        the Written Closing Submissions from Counsel for the Developers, after I had checked the numerous
        references provided. It involves considerable detail, but in broad terms, the development proceeds through
        the following stages:</p>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">426.1.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, the ‘<i>before</i>’ stage: it is
            important to note that, despite Dr Wright having numerous opportunities to mention that he had created
            the Bitcoin White Paper using LaTeX, but, more importantly, the notion that he had a LaTeX file which
            produced an ‘exact replica’ of the Bitcoin White Paper, such that mere possession of the file proved
            he was Satoshi, no mention of LaTeX was made in these proceedings until October 2023, or in any of the
            previous sets of litigation involving his claim to be Satoshi.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, the ‘<i>tease</i>’, namely what was
            said the LaTeX files established in Dr Wright’s evidence for the PTR, followed by the ‘<i>reveal</i>’,
            the provision of a compilation of his version of the Bitcoin White Paper (from LaTeX) on 13 December
            2023.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, the <i>‘(partly failed) cover
              up’</i>, in which the contrast is drawn between the fragmentary information made available
            concerning Dr Wright’s Overleaf account and Dr Wright’s efforts to resist the provision of metadata.

            submitted was inescapable evidence of forgery of the LaTeX files by Dr Wright.</p>
