<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Beyond the declarations I have already made,
              there was and remains a significant dispute over what further relief I should grant, particularly as to
              the injunctive relief sought by COPA and the Developers. Initially, it appeared to be common ground that
              disputes over relief were best left to be addressed at a form of order hearing following the hand down of
              this Judgment. However, in Lord Grabiner KC’s oral closing on Day 22, he urged me to decide all questions
              of relief in this Judgment and made submissions accordingly. Mr Hough KC addressed the issues raised over
              declaratory relief but urged me to defer my decision on injunctive relief until after (a) this Judgment
              had been handed down and (b) further argument in the light of it. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have concluded that I should defer the issues
              of injunctive relief. They will be argued at a Form of Order hearing to be appointed after the hand down
              of this Judgment.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">What remains is for me to thank all Counsel,
              Solicitors and their teams for the immense amount of work which has gone into this case, and I commend all
              for their high standards of professionalism in this hard-fought litigation. I also pay tribute to the
              organisation and presentation of the documents on the Opus2 platform. There was a vast volume of
              documentation on that platform for this Trial. Many of the documents were long but the relevant part was
              frequently only one or two lines. If we had worked from hard copy bundles, I am sure this Trial would have
              taken weeks longer.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should add that the respective teams conducted
              their respective cases with great efficiency. On Dr Wright’s side, his team led by Lord Grabiner KC and Mr
              Craig Orr KC undertook Dr Wright’s challenging case. As I mention on the title page, Mr Terence Bergin KC
              and Jack Castle represented the Claimants in the BTC Core claim, served short Skeleton Arguments and made
              brief oral submissions. Lord Grabiner KC and Craig Orr KC shared the cross-examination of COPA’s
              witnesses. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_944"><span class="judgment-body__number">944.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As appears from my summary of the expert
              evidence above, COPA undertook all the heavy lifting on the expert evidence from their side and almost all
              of it on the evidence of fact, with the Developers serving no expert evidence of their own and evidence of
              fact from Dr Wuille alone. There was no overlap in the cross-examinations of Dr Wright conducted by Mr
              Hough KC for COPA and Mr Gunning KC for the Developers, even though COPA bore the burden of proving their
              allegations of forgery as set out in the Appendix. As I mentioned above, the challenges to Dr Wright posed
              by Dr Wuille’s evidence were used to significant effect in support of the Developers’ case that Dr Wright
              was not Satoshi, and they also provided significant support to COPA’s case, both generally and on certain
              of the allegations of forgery. Finally, I should also add that Mr Hough KC and Mr Gunning KC were model
              leaders, giving their respective juniors, Mr Jonathan Moss and Ms Beth Collett, the opportunity to
              undertake some cross-examination in this major trial.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At the very start of the Trial, I mentioned that
              remote links to the proceedings had been provided (on individual request) to over 400 people from all over
              the world. By the conclusion of the Trial, that number had risen to over 1100, reflecting the wide
              interest in this Trial. All the recipients of those remote links owe a debt of gratitude to my clerk,
              Susan Woolley, and other court staff, for organising and providing those links, although I know that many
              thanked her personally by email and in generous terms. The vast majority of recipients abided by the
              conditions I imposed on each recipient of a remote link. In the very few cases where those conditions were
              breached, the breach was either swiftly remedied and an apology provided, or access was removed.</p>
