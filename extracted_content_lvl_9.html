<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA commenced this action on 9<sup>th</sup>
                April 2021. In their original Particulars of Claim, COPA pleaded their case that Dr Wright was not
                Satoshi by reference to publicly available events and documents, including (1) the Sartre Message, (2)
                the BlackNet Abstract, (3) the ‘12 March 2008 email’ and (4) the SSRN Submission, each of which COPA
                alleged to be forged. In addition, at that stage, COPA relied on various findings made in the
                <i>Kleiman</i> litigation (which were not relied on at Trial given the rule in <i>Hollington v
                  Hewthorn</i>, cited below), plus one other matter derived from the <i>Kleiman</i> litigation which was
                alleged to go to Dr Wright’s credibility: an allegation that an email purportedly from Dave Kleiman to
                Uyen Nguyen dated 20 December 2012 had been forged by Dr Wright. Obviously, at that stage, COPA did not
                know what other documents Dr Wright would rely upon as supporting his claim to be Satoshi.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright pleaded a full Defence in which he
                asserted in some detail his positive case that he was Satoshi and provided his explanations of the
                matters relied upon by COPA. With the benefit of hindsight, his Defence is notable for referring largely
                to documents which were made public by Satoshi. Bearing in mind the number of documents Dr Wright later
                disclosed as supporting his claim to be Satoshi, it is notable that the Defence did not make reference
                to any of them.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright did not file any Counterclaim.
                Following service of COPA’s Reply on 19<sup>th</sup> July 2021, Dr Wright issued an application seeking
                to strike out parts of the (by then) Amended Particulars of Claim which was heard by HHJ Paul Matthews
                in December 2021. He ruled that ‘forgery was in issue’ on the four particular documents pleaded by COPA.
                His Order gave permission for COPA to add a second matter derived from the Kleiman litigation: that a
                Deed of Trust document proffered by Dr Wright in the Kleiman case as evidencing the existence of a trust
                called the Tulip Trust had been backdated. At that point the case involved six allegedly forged
                documents.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The costs and case management conference was
                heard by Master Clark on 1<sup>st</sup> &amp; 2<sup>nd</sup> September 2022. Her Order (sealed on
                4<sup>th</sup> October 2022) set out directions down to the trial, which was subsequently listed to
                commence in January 2024. Of relevance are the following features of her Order:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Master considered and approved the
                    Disclosure Review Document, the purpose of which was to define the scope of disclosure to be given
                    and the searches which were to be carried out to locate relevant documents.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The parties were ordered to give extended
                    disclosure by 31<sup>st</sup> January 2023. In the event, extended disclosure took place on
                    7<sup>th</sup> March 2023. Both Dr Wright and COPA have given further disclosure at various points
                    subsequently, a point to which I return later. It is also relevant to note that a full discovery
                    exercise had already taken place for the <i>Kleiman</i> proceedings, and it involved Alix &amp;
                    Partners undertaking a comprehensive search at Dr Wright’s home for any computers, hard drives etc
                    which were to be (and were) imaged and searched for relevant documents.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 28<sup>th</sup> February 2023, Dr
                    Wright was to file ‘a list of documents upon which he primarily relies in relation to the factual
                    issue of whether or not he is the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. Such list will not preclude the
                    Defendant from relying upon other documents in support of his case and may be updated from time to
                    time to include further documents or to exclude documents.’ This list became known as Dr Wright’s
                    ‘<b>Primary Reliance Documents</b>’. Due to the slippage in the timetable, the list was produced on
                    4 April 2023, originally containing 100 documents, but updated subsequently in the light of some
                    further disclosure Dr Wright gave to 107.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On or before 28th March 2023, COPA was
                    given the power to request ‘<b>Chain of Custody</b>’ information for any of Dr Wright’s Primary
                    Reliance Documents, with the requested information to be supplied 4 weeks later. Following service
                    of Dr Wright’s list of his Primary Reliance Documents, COPA requested Chain of Custody information
                    for all of them.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On or before 31st March 2023, COPA was to
                    serve a list of any disclosed documents the authenticity of which was denied or not admitted (the
                    ‘<b>Challenged Documents</b>’). In the event, the list of Challenged Documents was served on 5 May
                    2023, (again later revised in the light of the further disclosure given by Dr Wright) which made
                    clear that COPA was challenging authenticity in respect of (almost) all of Dr Wright’s Reliance
                    Documents, as well as a large number of other documents in Dr Wright’s disclosure.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The following procedural steps were for
                    exchange of witness statements on 2nd June 2023, which in fact took place on 28 July 2023, followed
                    by sequential exchange of expert evidence on forensic document analysis, with COPA’s expert
                    originally set to serve his report on 30th June 2023, Dr Wright’s expert evidence on 25th August
                    2023 and a reply from COPA’s expert on 22nd September 2023. There was also provision for expert
                    evidence relating to relevant aspects of digital currency technology.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A point of some significance was a further
                    direction, made by the Master at the explicit request of Dr Wright’s then Counsel, for evidence of
                    fact in reply <i>after</i> all the expert evidence had been filed. In other words, Dr Wright
                    requested and obtained the ability to serve his evidence in reply in response to the expert
                    evidence.</p>
