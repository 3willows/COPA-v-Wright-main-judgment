<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Evidence may be admissible “<i>when it affects
                  the weight of other evidence tendered, e.g. evidence that affects the credit of a witness</i>”:
                <i>Phipson</i> at §7-04. In addition, evidence of character may be admissible as directly relevant to
                factual issues in the case, and in this context “<i>character</i>” encompasses a person’s reputation and
                their “<i>disposition to conduct themselves in some way or other</i>”: <i>Phipson</i> at §§17-01 to
                17-02. A witness may be required to give evidence in cross-examination on matters going solely to
                credit.</p>
