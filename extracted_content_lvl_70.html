<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although Dr Wright asserted in certain answers
              in cross-examination that there was a conspiracy against him involving COPA and Mr Ager-Hanssen, COPA
              emphasised in their Closing Submissions that they have had nothing to do with Mr Ager-Hanssen and merely
              relied on material publicly available due to his disclosures. For all the reasons set out in this Judgment
              (see the next section in particular), I am satisfied this alleged conspiracy was another lie from Dr
              Wright in his attempts to deflect responsibility from his own forgeries. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should add, for the avoidance of any doubt,
              that I have not relied or placed any weight on the reported conclusions of either Mr Ager-Hanssen or Mr
              Ayre. I have reached my own conclusions based only on the evidence and submissions I received during the
              Trial, albeit, as indicated above, I have also had regard to events which occurred during my case
              management pre-Trial.</p>
