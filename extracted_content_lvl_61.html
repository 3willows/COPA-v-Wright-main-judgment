<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The extent of security provided by a digital
              signature depends on the nature of the exercise undertaken to prove access to or control of a private key.
              Signing a message with a private key produces an output such that the Verify algorithm can be run to
              ensure that this message was signed by the person with the private key. The message must be a new one,
              since otherwise the recipient could simply copy a signed message and later hold it out as proof of
              ownership of the underlying private key (a process known as a “replay attack”). It is for this reason that
              a user must be asked to sign a new message. This explanation is significant for the topic of the Sartre
              message.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As with any validation process, there are
              certain steps in the digital signature process which require trust and verification, so that a party can
              be as sure as possible that what is being demonstrated is what it purports to be. If a user controls the
              software performing the signature verification or the software contains a bug, then the signature can
              appear to be verified when it is not truly verified. Trust in the software that is being used is therefore
              important. In a section of her report agreed by Mr Gao, Prof Meiklejohn set out several requirements which
              must be fulfilled to establish possession of a private key:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Unique message</u> – The message to be
                  signed must not have been signed before for that public key.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">335.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Method of and result of verification</u>
                  – The verification algorithm must be run using the public key, the new message and the signature given
                  by the user.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">335.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Semi-manual verification</u> –
                  Verification is rarely if ever performed on paper due to the size of the numbers involved. If instead
                  it is done using software on a computing device, then the verifier must trust that the computing
                  device is accurately performing each step.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Software integrity</u> – Usually, the
                  verifier runs the verification algorithm using an existing piece of software. Here, the person must
                  trust that the correct algorithm is being run, that it is using the correct inputs and that the
                  software is secure and has not been altered. This would include that it has been downloaded properly
                  and not over an unsecure connection.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Software and hardware integrity of the
                    computing device</u> – It is also necessary that the verifier trusts the hardware, operating system
                  and software on any computing device (i.e. not limited to the verification software itself). </p>
