<p><b>COPA’S EVIDENCE OF FACT</b></p>
<p><i>COPA’s witnesses of fact who were cross-examined</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I will deal with COPA’s witnesses in the order
              in which they gave their evidence i.e. these are the witnesses who gave live evidence and were
              cross-examined. In their closing submissions, Counsel for Dr Wright challenged aspects of the evidence of
              fact given by Mr Michael Hearn, Mr Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, Dr Adam Back and Mr Martti Malmi. I address these
              challenges below.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It will be seen below that COPA called a number
              of witnesses to address certain claims made by Dr Wright, both in his written statements but also in the
              course of his cross-examination. Many of these witnesses are third parties and I am grateful to them for
              their evidence and (for those who were cross-examined), making themselves available. Although a number of
              these witnesses were not required for cross-examination by Dr Wright’s legal team, there remained several
              where there was an acute conflict between their evidence and that of Dr Wright. Where it is necessary to
              do so, I have resolved all these conflicts but it is important to point out that I did not resolve each
              conflict in its own little silo. I could not help but be influenced, to varying degrees, by all the
              evidence I have heard.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Steven Lee</u> is an independent board
              member of COPA, who gave evidence in person. In cross-examination, Lord Grabiner KC was keen to explore
              the concept of independence in this context and Mr Lee’s other mentions of independence in his witness
              statement. This went nowhere. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Lee was a good witness. He answered all
              questions clearly and was plainly an entirely honest witness. He was asked questions about the Bitcoin
              Legal Defence Fund and whether it was funding the legal costs of the Developers in this litigation. Mr Lee
              said he did not know but said it was likely. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Martti Malmi</u> is a computer scientist
              who corresponded with Satoshi from shortly after the release of Bitcoin in January 2009 until early 2011,
              during which time he helped set up website content and worked on the Bitcoin Code, as well as the Linux
              port of the Bitcoin Software. In his first witness statement, Mr Malmi rejected various claims that Dr
              Wright had made about him and denied that he wrote a Satoshi post describing Bitcoin as a “cryptocurrency”
              (an allegation made by Dr Wright to explain away that post in circumstances where he disputes that label).
              He also exhibited emails he exchanged with Satoshi that previously were not public (correspondence never
              mentioned by Dr Wright). Mr Malmi also provided a short reply statement correcting statements made by Dr
              Wright about him.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_254"><span class="judgment-body__number">254.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Malmi gave evidence by videolink from
              Finland. He gave his evidence carefully and precisely. I was entirely satisfied he was telling the truth.
              His evidence was consistent with the contemporaneous documents. Furthermore, I agree with COPA’s
              submission that the attempts in his cross-examination to suggest that Mr Malmi had had contact with Dr
              Wright beyond what Mr Malmi had already acknowledged failed miserably. I discuss this in greater detail
              below.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Dr Adam Back</u> is a cryptographer and
              inventor of “Hashcash”, which was cited in the White Paper. He gave evidence of some email communications
              with Satoshi which had not previously been made public. They undermine Dr Wright’s accounts of his work on
              the White Paper before its release (as largely reiterated in Wright1). For instance, Dr Wright said that
              Wei Dai’s work profoundly influenced his development of Bitcoin for years, whereas Dr Back’s emails show
              that he told Satoshi about Wei Dai’s work on 21 August 2008 and that Satoshi had not previously known of
              it. Dr Back also provided a short second statement rebutting some of the claims Dr Wright makes about Dr
              Back’s attitude and interactions with Satoshi.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_256"><span class="judgment-body__number">256.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Back gave evidence in person. He gave his
              evidence in a careful and considered manner. He is plainly highly knowledgeable. The attack on his
              independence failed, in my view, an issue which again I discuss in greater detail below. Again, I was
              entirely satisfied he was telling the truth. Accordingly, I feel able to have confidence in his evidence.

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Mike Hearn</u> also gave his evidence in
              person. Mr Hearn is a software developer who worked on Bitcoin at the beginning and corresponded with
              Satoshi over email. He had dinner with Dr Wright and Mr Matthews in July 2016, when Mr Hearn asked Dr
              Wright questions about Bitcoin that he believed Satoshi would be able to answer. He said his impression
              was that Dr Wright could not answer his questions and that Mr Matthews shut down the conversation when Dr
              Wright got into difficulties. In cross-examination, he was the subject of robust challenge by Lord
              Grabiner KC on three points: first, whether he requested to meet Dr Wright in 2016, or whether the
              initiative came from Jon Matonis; second, whether he was aware that the business for which he worked in
              2016, R3, was a competitor of nChain; and third, what occurred at the dinner. These challenges were
              developed in some detail in Dr Wright’s closing, and it is more appropriate to address them in
              chronological context below (see [897] and following, below).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Howard Hinnant</u> gave his evidence by
              videolink from the USA. He is a software developer. Between 2005-2010 he was Chairman of the Library
              Working Group for the C++ Standards Committee. In his first witness statement, he stated that he was the
              lead designer and author of various standard features of C++ including the &lt;chrono&gt; time utilities,
              among others. Bird &amp; Bird asked him whether it would have been possible to use &lt;chrono&gt; or
              “sleep_for” in C++ code in October 2007. He gave various reasons why he said that would not have been
              possible including (a) that &lt;chrono&gt; or “sleep_for” were first standardised in C++11, i.e. in 2011;
              (b) the paper which first proposed both &lt;chrono&gt; or “sleep_for”, N2661, was published on
              11<sup>th</sup> June 2008; (c) prior to that date, implementations of &lt;chrono&gt; were limited to his
              own PC. He also considered various other possibilities, namely that, somehow &lt;chrono&gt; escaped into
              the wild and was picked up as early as October 2007. He was able to dismiss that possibility by reference
              to the previous iteration of N2661, namely N2498, on which he was also the lead author. N2498 is dated
              19<sup>th</sup> January 2008 but does not contain any mention of the word ‘chrono’, and ‘sleep_for’ is
              called ‘sleep’ in this iteration. Mr Hinnant also said that when N2498 was published, &lt;chrono&gt; and
              ‘sleep_for’ did not even exist on his computer.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After he had explained those matters to COPA’s
              solicitors, they provided him with three documents containing C++ source code disclosed by Dr Wright, each
              of which had the following metadata: Date Created 8<sup>th</sup> October 2007, Date Last Modified:
              31<sup>st</sup> October 2007; Date Last Accessed: 15<sup>th</sup> October 2007</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his cross-examination on Day 5, Dr Wright
              made a number of claims relevant to Mr Hinnant’s evidence, so COPA’s solicitors provided relevant extracts
              from the transcript to Mr Hinnant for any further comment. That resulted in Mr Hinnant’s second witness
              statement in which he addressed Dr Wright’s further claims and in particular, Dr Wright’s claim that he
              developed his own library using the header file &lt;chrono&gt;, based on an existing library called
              Project Chrono. Mr Hinnant explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘Project Chrono is not a time library as std::chrono is. It is a physics simulation library. One
                    would not modify a physics simulation library to come up with a time library. The similarities
                    between Project Chrono and the C++ standard header &lt;chrono&gt; end with the name “chrono”.’</i>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_261"><span class="judgment-body__number">261.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Hinnant said that Dr Wright’s claims gave
              rise to no less than three remarkable coincidences:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">261.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Mr Hinnant’s evidence was that it was
                  universal practice for all developers of non-standard libraries to put a filename extension on their
                  headers, typically .h. Yet Dr Wright was claiming to have created a file with a name identical to what
                  would be adopted by the C++ standard in the future, and in a style that only the C++ standard uses
                  (extension-less). That, he said, was a striking coincidence that any C++ programmer would find
                  difficult to accept.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">261.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, he pointed out that Dr Wright’s code
                  uses the phrase “std::chrono::milliseconds”. However:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘…Project Chrono does not even use class types to model time units like the standard library
                        does. It typically uses the built-in type double instead. So, Dr Wright claims to have invented
                        the namespace std::chrono and the class type milliseconds, identical in syntax to what would be
                        proposed for the C++ standard in the future. That strikes me as another remarkable
                        coincidence.’</i></p>
</section>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">261.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third: </p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘In conjunction with “std::chrono::milliseconds”, Dr Wright’s code uses the syntax
                        “std::this_thread::sleep_for”. This too would not be proposed for the C++ Standard until after
                        the last file modification dates for the code files referred to in my first statement. That
                        strikes me as a third remarkable coincidence.’</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Hinnant was cross-examined with great care by
              Mr Orr KC. Mr Orr sought to establish that what Dr Wright had claimed was <i>technically possible in
                theory</i>. However, in any practical environment, Mr Hinnant explained why Dr Wright’s claims were, in
              his succinct summary, ‘<b>absurd’</b>. Mr Hinnant also said Dr Wright’s story was ‘technically so
              outrageous that it’s… literally unbelievable’. It presupposed Dr Wright having gone to great effort to
              create a time library out of a package with an entirely different function, with the practical results
              that the code might well not compile at all or might not work as intended, as Mr Hinnant explained.
              Although Counsel for Dr Wright objected to any reliance being placed on these answers because they
              represented Mr Hinnant giving expert evidence, both answers were given in response to questions which
              plainly elicited those responses. I consider I am entitled to rely upon them. Furthermore, I formed the
              view that those answers were plainly true.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_263"><span class="judgment-body__number">263.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, Mr Hinnant gave clear and honest
              evidence. Dr Wright’s claims concerning &lt;chrono&gt; were a prime example where he had been caught out
              in his first account, but then sought to talk his way out by way of a technical explanation which turned
              out to be without basis. Mr Hinnant’s clear evidence showed that Dr Wright was lying.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn</u> is a computer
              scientist in the field of cryptography and cryptocurrency. He wrote early blogposts about Bitcoin and
              stated that he never received any Bitcoin from Satoshi, as Dr Wright has claimed he did. He also gave his
              evidence by videolink from the USA. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_265"><span class="judgment-body__number">265.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He has been involved in cryptography for many
              years, including from well before the development of Bitcoin. He worked on DigiCash in the 1990s and
              described himself as being ‘good friends’ with some well-known participants in the field including Hal
              Finney, Nick Szabo, Adam Back and Greg Maxwell, via interactions on Internet Relay Chat (‘IRC’) channels.
              He said that later on, he met others involved in Bitcoin after Satoshi, including Gavin Andresen and Peter
              Todd and ‘was active with those folks for years’.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He first became aware of Bitcoin when it was
              announced by Satoshi in 2008. He does not recall any occasion when he had any private discussions with
              Satoshi. On 26 January 2009, he published a post on his blog entitled ‘Decentralized Money’ which
              mentioned Bitcoin and included a link to bitcoin.org. He said that blog has been called the first blog
              post about Bitcoin, but he makes it clear that he never actually ran and used Bitcoin then. He recalled he
              first started using Bitcoin when using a matchmaking service where people traded Bitcoin and that one of
              his first transactions was with <i>druidian</i>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having stated those recollections to COPA’s
              solicitors, they provided him with a link in the web archive to the relevant records of the matchmaking
              service, which show his transaction with <i>druidian</i> in July 2012 and his earliest transaction in May
              2012. On that basis, he said he believed that May 2012 was around or shortly after the time when he first
              started using Bitcoin.</p>

              Nakamoto transferred Bitcoins to him in 2009-2011 and responded (in his witness statement) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘He did not transfer any bitcoin to me at any time. As I have explained above, he could not have
                    done because I didn’t use Bitcoin until years later than it was launched.’</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Wilcox-O’Hearn was a very engaging and
              careful witness. In my judgment he was transparently honest, willing to correct himself on reflection.
              Although Mr Orr KC made a manful effort in his cross-examination to suggest that Mr Wilcox-O’Hearn was
              mistaken about when he first dealt in Bitcoin and therefore he did receive some Bitcoin from Satoshi
              Nakamoto, I am entirely satisfied that Mr Wilcox-O’Hearn did not start his dealing in Bitcoin until around
              May 2012 and that he was not in any position to receive any Bitcoin from Satoshi at any time in the period
              when Satoshi was actively involved in the running of Bitcoin. He also revealed how passionate he was about
              Satoshi Nakamoto, referring to him as his “hero” and saying with some force that if, as alleged by Dr
              Wright, he had received bitcoin from his hero, he would certainly have remembered it. When it was put to
              him that he must have become more actively involved earlier, he replied disarmingly: “<i>You underestimate
                my laziness and procrastination</i>.” <b>{Day14/81:2}</b>. It is thus clear that Dr Wright’s claims
              (made initially in an interview with GQ in June 2017, and then in the <i>McCormack</i> and <i>Granath</i>
              cases) to have sent Bitcoin to Mr Wilcox-O’Hearn were failed guesswork, based on the public information
              that he was the first person to have blogged about bitcoin, shortly after its release. On this issue, I
              unhesitatingly prefer the evidence of Mr Wilcox-O’Hearn.</p>
