<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In all the detail which follows, it should be
              kept in mind that if Dr Wright really was Satoshi, a reliable private signing could have been performed
              very easily and simply. He could have signed a message on his computer, using the private key associated
              with the public key for block 9. That signed message could have been passed via a clean USB stick to, for
              example, Mr Andresen, who could then have run the Verify algorithm on his own laptop to determine if it
              was genuine. Nothing more complicated was required.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Against that simple point (on which the experts
              were agreed) there is a marked contrast with the complicated and elaborate procedures which seem to have
              been adopted by Dr Wright.</p>
