<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are some curiosities about the evidence
              concerning this dinner:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">911.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, I have evidence from Mr Hearn, Mr
                  Matthews and Dr Wright, but none from Mr Matonis on which I consider I can rely (who seems to have
                  still believed that Dr Wright was Satoshi, at least prior to the dinner) or Ms Watts.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">911.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, even though this dinner took place
                  just over 2 months after the Sartre blog, and the public comment in relation to that, there was no
                  recognition of that in any of the evidence relating to the dinner.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">911.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, much was made at trial that the
                  company for whom Mr Hearn was working at the time, R3, was a competitor of nChain. If that was the
                  case, it is very curious that Dr Wright was happy not just to have a long dinner with Mr Hearn but to
                  be prepared to answer a whole series of technical questions related to Bitcoin. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">911.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, the dinner occurred in circumstances
                  where the issue as to whether Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi was still very much live. By agreeing to
                  dine and have a discussion with one of the developers, Dr Wright must have known that he would be
                  questioned on technical details.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_912"><span class="judgment-body__number">912.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition, I was struck by the fact that the
              whole section in <b>Wright11</b> on this dinner at <b>[435]-[462]</b> was in Section VI where he gave his
              response to COPA’s witnesses (other than Mr Malmi and Mr Gerlach). Thus, there were passages on Dr Back
              (and Wei Dai) [369]-[393], Steve Lee [394]-[404], Dustin Trammell [405]-[409], Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn
              [410]-[430], Professor Wrightson and Dr Furche [431]-[434] and a section on Professor Stroustrup and Mr
              Hinnant [463]-[471]. For reasons explained elsewhere, I have found much of this evidence from Dr Wright to
              be pure fantasy on his part (so too, the earlier passages regarding Mr Malmi and Mr Gerlach), so the
              suspiciously specific details set out in <b>Wright11</b> in relation to the technical discussion at the
              dinner could lie in a similar vein. Indeed, Mr Hearn’s view that Dr Wright engaged in technobabble
              coincides with the impression I formed of a number of passages in Dr Wright’s answers at trial, when he
              was under pressure.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_913"><span class="judgment-body__number">913.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not believe that I have sufficient detail
              to be able to reach firm findings as to precisely what occurred at this dinner. If I was to view the
              disputes in relation to this dinner in isolation (which was the implicit invitation in Dr Wright’s
              submissions), I might well have concluded that there was some substance in the suspicions on both sides.
            </p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_914"><span class="judgment-body__number">914.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, I am clear that it would be wrong to
              view this dinner in isolation. Dr Wright’s submissions effectively invite me to find that Mr Hearn had
              some sort of axe to grind against Dr Wright and attended the dinner for that purpose. In his evidence, Dr
              Wright made a variety of allegations against the Developers, all of which I have found to be baseless.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_915"><span class="judgment-body__number">915.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In these circumstances and in the circumstances
              of this case more generally, on balance, I make the following findings as regards the dinner:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is likely that Mr Matonis was the driver
                  of getting Mr Hearn and Dr Wright together at the dinner because Mr Matonis wanted Mr Hearn to confirm
                  his own view that Dr Wright was Satoshi. Mr Hearn’s evidence on that point rang true: in effect he was
                  saying he did not have a burning desire to have a discussion with Dr Wright, but he said he would
                  otherwise have had to eat on his own that evening if he didn’t go to the dinner.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Hearn undoubtedly came away from the
                  dinner believing that Dr Wright was not Satoshi and said so to Mr Matonis. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The discussion at the dinner was between Mr
                  Hearn, who had been involved as a developer of the Bitcoin code until the end of 2015, and Dr Wright
                  who had gone public that he was Satoshi. I consider it is likely that Dr Wright did struggle with some
                  of the technical details which Mr Hearn asked about. I also consider it is likely that Mr Matthews was
                  primed to step in to shut down technical discussions if Dr Wright was struggling, with the excuse that
                  it might endanger the nChain patent filings.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Hearn confirmed that Mr Matthews did
                  deploy this excuse at the dinner, but he was clearly sceptical about it – he made the point that he
                  was asking Dr Wright about Satoshi’s original intentions for Bitcoin – in other words, the content of
                  the Bitcoin White Paper, the original or very early versions of the Bitcoin Source Code, all of which
                  was 7 years in the past by the time of the dinner. Mr Hearn made the obvious point that nothing in the
                  public domain could be patented but he was asking Dr Wright about details which were not in the public
                  domain. Taking the view which is most favourable to Dr Wright, it is therefore conceivable that there
                  may have been some overlap and therefore conflict between what would have been full answers to Mr
                  Hearn’s questions and the areas which Dr Wright was seeking to develop in nChain patent filings.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.5.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Let me assume that this conflict was
                  perceived to exist on Dr Wright’s side. I return to my initial assessment of Mr Hearn’s evidence. I
                  must balance that against the evidence of Dr Wright and Mr Matthews. I have found Dr Wright to be a
                  thoroughly unreliable witness who has engaged in forgery on a grand scale and, in his attempts to
                  sustain his case, has lied extensively. I have found Mr Matthews to have been more careful in his
                  evidence, but still to have lied in his bid to support Dr Wright’s case. These are not circumstances
                  in which I am inclined to reject Mr Hearn’s evidence.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">915.6.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In conclusion, on all three points of
                  challenge, I find that Mr Hearn’s evidence was clear and in no sense overstated. He recalled matters
                  which were important to him and had less recall about other matters. The implication underpinning
                  these challenges was that Mr Hearn had some axe to grind against Dr Wright. I am entirely satisfied he
                  did not and that he gave his evidence honestly and entirely fairly.</p>
