<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition to the forged Blacknet documents,
              there are some authentic ones. These provide a very useful backdrop against which to assess Dr Wright’s

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright claims that he began his journey with
              working at OzEmail on the implementation of a payment protocol known as Millicent. This led, in 1998, to
              him embarking on a project known as “Project BlackNet”, the purpose of which he says was to create a fully
              secure encrypted internet explicitly for business-to-business transactions. Dr Wright says the concept of
              “<i>crypto credits</i>” in BlackNet was conceived by a combination of ideas Dr Wright says he took from
              Millicent, and he adds that this “<i>laid the foundational groundwork</i>” for Bitcoin. He says little
              else in <b>Wright1</b> about Project BlackNet, but it features heavily in his Reliance Documents and is as
              prominent in <b>Madden1</b>.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_595"><span class="judgment-body__number">595.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The documents which appear to be authentic
              suggest that Project BlackNet was a (real or purported) project based on his IT security work and involved
              creating an end-to-end encrypted network. This can be seen in the document dated Thursday 3 October 2002
              called “ITOL Project “BlackNet”, with the stated objective being “<i>to integrate a number of off the
                shelf products in a clever and unique way to develop a product that will provide Fire-walling, IPSEC
                VPN’s, Intrusion Detection and SSL Acceleration Management.</i>”<b> {L1/80/5}</b>. Some other versions
              of Project BlackNet documents, on which Dr Wright relies, contain sections which appear to foreshadow
              elements of Bitcoin, but (a) those documents have been backdated; (b) the sections are incongruous (as
              well as being absent from genuine versions); and (c) the new sections envisage a further phase involving a
              peer-to-peer transaction system, but that phase is absent from the budget (which describes the previous
              phase as the “final” one).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Cross-examination of Dr Wright confirmed that
              Project Blacknet had nothing to do with Bitcoin. Dr Wright’s attempts to tie Blacknet to being “premised
              on crypto credits”, suffer from the flaw that none of the authentic Blacknet documents says anything about
              such crypto credits.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the forged versions of Project Blacknet,
              these are addressed in section 5 of the Appendix. It is clear that the supposed extra “Stage 4” of the
              project has been added to try and retrospectively make Dr Wright’s Project Blacknet appear to be tied to
              cryptocurrency concepts.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_598"><span class="judgment-body__number">598.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Other than the documents which I have found to
              be forged, my attention was not drawn by Dr Wright’s Counsel to any other reliable contemporaneous
              document which has been shown to be authentic to support his evidence on these points. As I have already
              said, Dr Wright’s lies have been so extensive and pervasive I do not find myself able to place any weight
              on something he has said unless it is corroborated by some other source which I find reliable.</p>
