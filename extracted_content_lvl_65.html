<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Before descending into the detail, Counsel for
              Dr Wright submitted I should be cautious about making any forgery findings against Dr Wright, for the
              following reasons:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">345.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, because forgery allegations are of
                  the utmost seriousness and would, if established, do great damage to Dr Wright’s reputation and future
                  endeavours. In this regard, I was reminded of the principles which I set out in paragraph 113 above.
                  This point is undoubtedly true, but if forgery is established the person responsible must live with
                  the consequences of their actions.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">345.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, because COPA’s evidence, it was
                  submitted, was neither satisfactory nor cogent. For the reasons explained in this Judgment and in the
                  Appendix, I reject this. COPA’s evidence was cogent and compelling.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">345.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">‘The <b>third</b> reason is that, due to how
                  late in the proceedings they were raised and the unfortunate sequencing of the relevant factual and
                  expert evidence, it has not been possible for the forgery allegations to be explored and responded to
                  in a suitable way.’</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_346"><span class="judgment-body__number">346.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This third reason was developed in the following
              way. First, I was reminded of the procedural history of the development of the forgery allegations
              following the service of <b>Madden1</b>. I have been acutely aware of this procedural history throughout
              my case management of this litigation down to and including this Trial. I have summarised it above.
              Second, attention was drawn to Dr Wright’s reply evidence in <b>Wright9, 10 &amp; 11</b> and in particular
              to his evidence that ‘<i>a number of the anomalies identified by Mr Madden and relied on by COPA as
                evidence of forgery were the innocent result of his complex computer environment and collaborative
                working practices</i>.’ Then, this submission was made:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘Ideally, this evidence should have formed the factual background to Mr Madden’s analysis from the
                    outset. Instead, this case has involved the reversal of the orthodox sequencing of factual and
                    expert evidence, where the former comes first and forms the factual basis for the latter. As a
                    result, the very lengthy detail of Dr Wright’s complex computer environment has received only
                    cursory treatment by Mr Madden, across just over 2 pages of his fourth report.’</i></p>
</section>
</blockquote>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_347"><span class="judgment-body__number">347.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That last sentence is a travesty of the true
              position, as Counsel for COPA demonstrated when responding to it. In summary:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">347.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is true that Dr Wright devoted many
                  paragraphs when describing his ‘<i>complex computer environment’ </i>(particularly in <b>Wright8</b>
                  and <b>10</b>), but in reality there were relatively few technical points which emerged which were
                  capable of affecting the allegations of forgery.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">347.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am entirely satisfied that Mr Madden
                  considered Dr Wright’s explanations carefully. In <b>Madden4</b>, it was apparent that Mr Madden had
                  reviewed <b>Wright9, 10 &amp; 12</b>, and had been asked specifically whether they led him to change
                  his opinions in that Report or in his previous reports. He stated in terms ‘<i>They do not</i>’. In
                  that review process, I am certain that Mr Madden adhered to his duties as an expert, in particular to
                  be ready to change an opinion on new information coming to his or her attention.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">347.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">One of the reasons why Mr Madden was able to
                  address these points relatively succinctly in <b>Madden4</b> was because he had already taken account
                  of any that mattered in his first report. To cite two examples, in Appendix 24 to his first report, Mr
                  Madden acknowledged the possibility of overlapping edit times due to multiple computers being operated
                  simultaneously, but made it clear that he did not draw any conclusions on individual documents on the
                  basis of edit time observations <u>alone</u>. They are not irrelevant but part of the context. In the
                  same Appendix, Mr Madden took account of the possibility of multiple virtual machines being in
                  operation simultaneously – long before Dr Wright even raised the point.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">347.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In any event, Mr Madden’s analysis and
                  COPA’s reasons for alleging forgery identified, in each case, numerous indicators which, when
                  combined, gave rise to a compelling case which Dr Wright was unable to answer. Further, when
                  considered against all the circumstances of this case, the compelling case on each allegation of
                  forgery became unanswerable.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_348"><span class="judgment-body__number">348.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore, the complaint about reversing the
              orthodox sequencing of factual and expert evidence has very little substance, bearing in mind (a) this was
              done at the explicit request of Dr Wright’s then Counsel and (b) Dr Wright’s late and very late disclosure
              of documents said to be critical to his case. In any event, I am entirely satisfied that all matters
              relating to Dr Wright’s ‘<i>complex computer environment and collaborative working practices</i>’ were
              fully considered by the experts and fully explored in evidence. It should also be noted that (a) Dr
              Wright’s own experts did not support his position and (b) the ‘<i>innocent explanation</i>’ came from Dr
              Wright himself. When considering the allegations of forgery, I have taken into account some of Dr Wright’s
              points regarding persistence (as the experts did) and also differences between Windows and Unix systems as
              regards certain aspects of metadata. It is, however, clear that the experts did not rely on metadata
              anomalies alone. Furthermore, as explained in the Appendix, for each document alleged to have been forged,
              there were numerous pieces of supportive evidence, which are only reinforced by the overall scale of Dr
              Wright’s forgery. In short, those matters do not provide an innocent explanation for all or even some of
              the alleged forgeries.</p>
