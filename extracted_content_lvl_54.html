              which can be denoted as H, that has the following properties: </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It takes in inputs of arbitrary size
                  (meaning that they can be nearly any size and the size does not matter in practice). </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is efficiently computable, meaning given
                  any input it is fast to compute the output. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is pre-image resistant. This means that
                  given a hash h it is hard to find an input x such that H(x) = h. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The most used hash function today is SHA256, and
              this is what Bitcoin uses. SHA256 hashes are usually encoded and expressed as a string containing 64
              alphanumeric characters, such as the string
              2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 (the hex encoding of the SHA256 hash of
              “hello”).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Bitcoin White Paper defines a coin as “a
              chain of digital signatures”. An owner transfers a coin by “digitally signing” a “hash” of the previous
              transaction involving the coin and the public key of the next owner. Because the hash used in a
              transaction includes both the previous transaction involving the coin and the public key of the next
              owner, the hash embeds the history of expenditure of that coin.</p>
