<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright had given a confusing account of the
              method by which he had supposedly compiled the White Paper LaTeX Files at <b>Wright8 [74-76]
                {E/23/22}</b>. He suggested that his “<i>Linux environment was integrated with Windows and supported
                Wine</i>”. He went on to refer to MiKTeX being “<i>configured on Linux to use LaTeX packages and
                compilers including … TeX Live: I used this as an alternative to MiKTeX on Linux</i>”. He concluded by
              saying that “<i>These tools offered functionality similar to what MiKTeX provided on Windows</i>”. This
              was more technobabble, for the reasons set out below.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is difficult to square that <i>ex post
                facto</i> rationalisation of Dr Wright’s evidence with what he actually said in his witness statement.
              The real explanation for Dr Wright’s evidence is that he did not know what he was talking about in
              <b>Wright8</b>, because he had not used LaTeX in the way that he was describing. In any event, Mr
              Rosendahl identified 6 characteristics of the White Paper LaTeX Files that demonstrated that they could
              not have been used to compile the Bitcoin White Paper.</p>
