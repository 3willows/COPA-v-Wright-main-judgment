<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As already mentioned, the signing session with
              Mr Andresen was different from the others because Mr Andresen wanted the signed message to be verified on
              his computer and Dr Wright’s team agreed to a laptop being bought for the purpose. This session involved
              Dr Wright signing a message on his laptop, transferring the signature to the new laptop and verifying the
              signature on that laptop. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So much is common to Dr Wright’s account and Mr
              Andresen’s (which was given in <i>Kleiman</i> by reference to notes in the form of a Reddit exchange with
              another person).</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright2</b>, Dr Wright gave his version.
              He claimed that the new laptop was set up by Mr Andresen, and that Mr Andresen installed Windows,
              connected to the hotel’s Wi-Fi network and downloaded Electrum software directly from the official
              website. Dr Wright said that when downloading Electrum, Mr Andresen verified the integrity of the software
              by comparing its hash value to the one provided on the website. Dr Wright then described that, for each of
              block 1 and 9, he produced a signed message on his laptop; that he transferred it via USB stick to the new
              laptop; and that he then performed the verification with the Electrum software on the new laptop while Mr
              Andresen watched. Dr Wright recalled that the process initially failed, but only because the original
              message had been typed into Electrum incorrectly. The error was then corrected and the signature was
              verified.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Andresen recalled that a hot-spot might have
              been used for internet access, a detail Dr Wright accepted in his <i>Granath</i> evidence. Mr Andresen was
              also clear that Dr Wright downloaded and installed the software on the new laptop, including the Electrum
              software. Mr Andresen could not recall having verified that the Electrum software had the HTTPS security
              certificate from the website. In <i>Kleiman</i>, when asked whether he had verified the hash digest of the
              download against anything he had brought with him, Mr Andresen said that he had not done so, and he did
              not suggest that he had verified the hash digest by any other means. Mr Andresen recalled that the message
              signed was “<i>Gavin’s favourite number is 11 – CSW</i>”. The Reddit notes indicate that on the first try
              Mr Andresen had omitted “<i>– CSW</i>”, after which the verification failed, but that Dr Wright then
              identified the omission.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his evidence at trial, Dr Wright sought to
              bring his account into line with Mr Andresen’s. He said that he could not remember which of them had
              downloaded what, but tried to insist that Mr Andresen had been watching his every move
              <b>{Day8/68:12}</b>. He admitted that Mr Andresen may well have been right in his recollection of the
              message and how the verification initially failed <b>{Day8/72:16}</b>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Prof Meiklejohn addressed the possibility of
              this session being faked. She explained that there are a number of ways in which it would have been
              possible for Dr Wright to do this by use of software. These include: (a) downloading a non-genuine version
              of Electrum wallet software; (b) downloading genuine Electrum software but running malware on the new
              laptop to interfere with its operation; or (c) altering the download of Electrum or introducing malware
              through internet connection being compromised (e.g. through a device used to provide a hotspot). COPA
              pointed out that Dr Wright’s account diverges from Mr Andresen’s on the key points of (i) who set up the
              laptop; (ii) who downloaded Electrum; and (iii) whether there was any verification of the Electrum
              software. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Once again, it is also important to note the
              point I made at the outset (see [834] above) that a reliable private signing could have easily been
              performed much more simply and without any proper concern about allowing Mr Andresen access to the private
              keys. COPA submitted that the adoption of Dr Wright’s complex process (involving the purchase of a new
              computer) in favour of that simple process spoke volumes. COPA invited the inference that the complex
              process was adopted because it could be staged. </p>
