<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At (and before) the Trial it was common ground
                that Dr Wright suffers from Autism Spectrum Disorder, which covers a very wide spectrum. On 8 September
                2023, Dr Wright served a report from Professor Seena Fazel which suggested that some radical adjustments
                were required (including receipt of all questions in advance) if Dr Wright was to give evidence.
                Professor Fazel had formed his view based on interviews with Dr Wright but without being told that Dr
                Wright had given evidence and been cross-examined before. In particular, Professor Fazel was not given
                access to any of the videos (e.g. from the <i>Granath </i>proceedings in Norway) showing him being
                cross-examined without apparently any problem at all. After I had given permission to rely on that
                report, COPA served their report from Professor Michael Craig on 21 November 2023, who had seen the
                videos. The experts met and agreed a very useful Joint Statement which recommended only limited
                adjustments. Their agreement was the basis for the Order I made at the PTR, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘Pursuant to CPR PD1A, the Court shall adopt for the evidence of Dr Wright at trial the
                      adjustments agreed upon by the parties experts in ASD, namely (a) there being clear timetabling of
                      Dr Wright’s evidence; (b) him being given access to a pen and paper; (c) him being given access to
                      a real time transcription screen; (d) there being a lower threshold for breaks in evidence,
                      particularly if he becomes emotionally dysregulated; and (e) follow-up questions being relatively
                      shorter in the event of Dr Wright becoming emotionally dysregulated.’</i></p>
