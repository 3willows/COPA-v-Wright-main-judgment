      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Apparently unbeknownst to Dr Wright, the
        alterations he made to the White Paper LaTeX Files between 17:29 on 17 November 2023 and 17:07 on 24
        November 2023 were recorded by Overleaf and are now available in the chunks.json files. From those data,
        the Developers created the two animations at <b>{L21/12}</b> and <b>{L21/13}</b>. The former is set
        against a blank background, the latter against the control version of the March 2009 Bitcoin White Paper.
      </p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I agree that the animations produced by the
        Developers illustrating the output of those alterations show the process by which Dr Wright forged the
        White Paper LaTeX Files in real time. They are the digital equivalent of a video capturing Dr Wright in
        the act of forgery.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_481"><span class="judgment-body__number">481.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The following information emerges from the
        animations themselves:</p>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">481.1.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first frame of the animation (which is
            derived from the first version of the BitcoinSN.tex file, which was in turn drawn from TC8.tex: see
            paragraph 449 above) shows that Dr Wright had managed to produce a reasonable approximation of the
            first page of the Bitcoin White Paper. Even that first page was far from perfect, and it was certainly
            not an “exact replica”. However, it may have been sufficiently similar for Dr Wright to try to
            persuade Shoosmiths that the document was of some probative value. I agree the rest of the document
            was a mess.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Over the course of the next few hours, Dr
            Wright focussed his attention on making adjustments to the text of the first page of the White Paper
            LaTeX Files. He then proceeded to make adjustments to the remaining pages in a broadly sequential
            order.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">481.3.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The process was extremely hit-and-miss. For
            example, at about 14:21 on 18 November 2023, Dr Wright made a change to the formatting of the headings
            by introducing a “stretchtitle” command which caused them to jump to unnatural sizes {see row 535 at
            <b>{L21/5}</b>}. But more generally the blank-background version of the animation shows the stretching
            and shrinking of spaces between words and knock-on effects for line-breaks, page breaks and so on.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright also had to play with the
            placement of the images in the Bitcoin White Paper. Initially, the images in BitcoinSN.tex were mostly
            comprised of png images (though Image1 was based on the importation of the Image1.tex file from an
            Images subfolder). Dr Wright gradually replaced those image files with pdf images that he had created
            from those image.tex files, that he effectively had to drag into place {In <b>{L21/5}</b>, the
            replacement of the image.tex files can be seen for Image1 at Row 498, for Image2 at Row 703, for
            Image3 at Row824, for Image4 at Row 1075, for Image5 at Row 1073, for Image6 at Row 1066 and for
            Image7 at Row 1064}. The effective dragging and dropping of image 1 can be seen in the
            blank-background version of the animation from Rows 625 to 679 (each frame in the animation can be
            advanced individually by using the right-arrow key on a keyboard).</p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, the process was not one in which
        “<i>minor corrections</i>” were being made to put right known “<i>typographical errors</i>” in the Bitcoin
        White Paper (as had been stated twice by Shoosmiths on instructions from Dr Wright {Shoosmiths’ letter
        dated 13 December 2023 at [3.1] <b>{AB-A/2/67}</b> and Shoosmiths’ letter dated 29 December 2023 at [3]
        {<b>AB-A/2/141}</b>}).</p>
    </div>

  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_483"><span class="judgment-body__number">483.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Instead what the animations illustrate is that
        Dr Wright was trying to get his White Paper LaTeX files to fit the formatting of the Bitcoin White Paper.
        He was literally reverse-engineering the White Paper LaTeX Files from the Bitcoin White Paper. That was
        the very process that on 1 December 2023 he had sworn (in support of his application of that date) was
        “<i>practically infeasible</i>”.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_484"><span class="judgment-body__number">484.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Perhaps appreciating the impossibility of the
        “<i>minor corrections</i>” explanation formerly provided, when the unredacted chunks.json files were
        produced to COPA and the Developers on 16 February 2024, Dr Wright instructed Shoosmiths that {Shoosmiths’
        letter dated 16 February 2024 at [14] <b>{M/3/16}</b>}:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <section>
          <p><i>“Dr Wright did edit the code in the intervening years for personal experimentation and to make
              corrections and improvements, and for the purposes of the demonstrations referred to above, and that
              Dr Wright then sought to undo the changes to the LaTeX code he had made since publication of the
              Bitcoin White Paper in order to put the code into the form that would compile the Bitcoin White
              Paper”.</i></p>

      </blockquote>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_485"><span class="judgment-body__number">485.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That explanation is untenable in light of the
        changes recorded in the chunks.json and visible in the animations. It is absurd to suggest that the
        process of continual, iterative change and adjustment demonstrated through the animations represents the
        “<i>undoing</i>” of changes made previously. Still less is it tenable that the changes were made during
        demonstrations. </p>

          demonstrations</i>” explanation in his oral evidence, as for example in the following passages on Day

        Wright was not otherwise demonstrating anything to anybody. He was trying to work out what adjustments he
