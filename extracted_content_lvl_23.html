        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Witness statements of fact should not be used
          as a vehicle to deliver what ought to be expert evidence (with the proper safeguards attached to such
          evidence applying), and the Court may disallow opinion evidence put in fact witness statements on this
          basis: <i>New Media Distribution Co SEZC v Kagalovsky</i><b> </b>[2018] EWHC 2742 (Ch) at §10; <i>Glaxo
            Wellcome UK Ltd v Sandoz Ltd</i> [2019] RPC 26 at §§5-15. However, a witness of fact may give opinion
          evidence directly related to the factual evidence he/she gives: see the survey of authority in
          <i>Polypipe Ltd v Davidson</i> [2023] EWHC 1681 (Comm) at §§17-31.

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As COPA submitted, on many points in this
          case, the experts on each side are in agreement with each other but Dr Wright takes issue with the
          common views. The legal position is clear that “<i>where experts are agreed on a matter within their
            technical expertise, a judge will only rarely reject that evidence; and should not do so without
            applying considerable caution and giving adequate reasons</i>”: <i>Whiting v First / Keolis
            Transpennine Ltd</i> [2018] EWCA Civ 4 at §34.</p>
