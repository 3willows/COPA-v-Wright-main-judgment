        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In their third letter of 9 June 2023, Ontier
          set out the list of 107 Primary Reliance Documents. The first set of Chain of Custody information was
          set out in an Annex to the letter dated 8 July 2023 from Dr Wright’s new solicitors, Travers Smith LLP.

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By letter dated 13 October 2023, Dr Wright’s
          third set of solicitors, Shoosmiths LLP (then recently instructed), wrote enclosing a second set of
          Chain of Custody information in a detailed spreadsheet, pursuant to paragraph 3 of my Order of
          3<sup>rd</sup> October 2023. This is a document of some significance. Some entries are confusing and
          internally inconsistent, but the overall effect was to suggest that most of his Reliance Documents had
          been used or accessed by others after being produced, such that they could have been altered. It
          repeatedly indicated that more reliably authentic versions of Reliance Documents might be available on
          the “new drives”. In his statement of 23 October 2023 answering the RFI requests (<b>Wright4</b>), Dr
          Wright also provided a schedule {CSW5 at <b>{F/148/2}} </b>addressing versions of the White Paper in
          disclosure in which he told a similar story of those documents being unreliable.</p>
