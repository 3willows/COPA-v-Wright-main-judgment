<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bitcoin users can identify themselves using, for
        example, their public key or (more commonly) addresses, which are alphanumeric identifiers that are
        different from, but often related to the public key. Prior to 2012, the only type of address used in
        Bitcoin transactions was a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH), whereas sending to a public key was referred to
        as pay-to-public key (P2PK).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When addresses are derived from public keys,
        each address has its associated private key that can be used to sign messages. Accordingly, given an
        address, a public key, a signature and a message, anyone can verify whether or not (a) the address was
        derived from the public key and (b) the signature and signed message are valid for that public key. It is
        these properties that allow Bitcoin users to transfer ownership of bitcoins they possess such that they
        can be independently verified, but without disclosing the real world identity of the individual with the
        private key. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Bitcoin, a transaction can have multiple
        senders and recipients. Senders and recipients are identified using addresses, and the value being sent or
        received by each party is identified in bitcoins. Bitcoins are divisible, and can be divided to the eighth
        decimal place; i.e., the smallest amount it is possible to send is 1 x 10<sup>-8</sup> bitcoin
        (0.00000001).</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_324"><span class="judgment-body__number">324.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A transaction contains, in its simplest form, an
        input corresponding to the sender and one output corresponding to the recipient. The transaction output
        (TXO) consists of the recipientâ€™s address and the value of bitcoin sent to that address. A Bitcoin
        transaction also contains a digital signature from the sender, where the message being signed contains the
        rest of the information detailing the transaction. This allows peers on the network to verify the
        transaction, as they can look at the address, public key and signature to check that the public key aligns
        with the address and the signature verifies it.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_325"><span class="judgment-body__number">325.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As transactions are public, it is possible to
        check to see if the address was used before, to confirm that the address did in fact receive the number of
        bitcoin it is now spending. To prevent double spending, Bitcoin tracks which transaction outputs are
        unspent and allows only those unspent outputs to spend the coins they receive. Sometime in about 2011 or
        2012, the term UTXO was introduced to refer to an unspent transaction output.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_326"><span class="judgment-body__number">326.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Moving beyond the simple example with one input
        and one output, transactions with multiple inputs function in the same way: each transaction input needs
        to specify its own distinct UTXO and valid signature on the transaction data. Transactions with multiple
        inputs do not necessarily have multiple senders, as they could just represent one sender spending the
        contents of multiple UTXOs associated with the same address. </p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_327"><span class="judgment-body__number">327.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Similarly, transactions can have multiple
        transaction outputs, where again there can be multiple distinct addresses (representing different
        recipients) or not. This latter type of transaction is needed to divide bitcoins, as again any bitcoins
        received in a transaction must be spent all at once. For example, if a user has 10 BTC associated with a
        UTXO and wants to send two bitcoins to another user, they can form a transaction with one input
        representing their 10 BTC UTXO (and a valid associated signature) and two outputs: one containing the
        address of the other user and receiving 2 BTC, and the other containing an address they control and
        receiving 8 BTC. In this way, a user can make change, just as happens when spending physical cash.</p>
