        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In January 2023, four actions were docketed to
          me:</p>
        <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
              style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">52.1.</span></span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first was the COPA action.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
              style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">52.2.</span></span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second and third actions (the
              <i>Coinbase</i> and <i>Kraken</i> Actions) were issued on the same day by Dr Wright and associated
              companies against two sets of defendants which have been referred to as the Coinbase and Kraken
              Defendants respectively. In each of those actions, the claim is for passing off by reference to the
              term Bitcoin. The claimants claim to own goodwill in the term Bitcoin, underpinned by what are
              alleged to be important and defining characteristics including those designated in the Particulars
              of Claim as the ‘Bitcoin Characteristics’. The cause of action in passing off is said to be
              sufficient to prevent third parties (including the Coinbase and Kraken Defendants) from using the
              term Bitcoin in relation to digital assets with tickers BTC and BCH.

        <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
              style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">52.3.</span></span>
          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The fourth action was IL-2022-000069
              between Dr Wright (and two companies) and 26 Defendants (<i>Wright v BTC Core</i>), which I refer to
              as ‘the BTC Core action’. In this action, Dr Wright claims to be the owner of certain database
              rights which he says subsist in three databases, namely (i) the Bitcoin Blockchain, (ii) the Bitcoin
              Blockchain as it stood on 1 August 2017 at 14.11 – up to and including block 478,558 and (iii)
              another part of the Bitcoin Blockchain made in a particular period (the details of which do not
              matter for present purposes). Dr Wright also says he (or one of the Claimants) owns the copyrights
              which subsist in the Bitcoin White Paper and in the Bitcoin File Format. The Defendants to the BTC
              Core claim include COPA, various other corporate entities which are members of COPA (and for that
              reason have not themselves played a role in this Trial) and the Developers.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After these cases were docketed to me, the
          first applications I had to deal with were at a Joint CMC listed in the Coinbase and Kraken Actions on
          25<sup>th</sup> &amp; 26<sup>th</sup> May 2023. One of the applications was by the Coinbase and Kraken
          Defendants seeking a stay of each of those actions pending Judgment in the COPA Action. This was a
          logical application for these Defendants to make since (a) whether Dr Wright was Satoshi would be
          determined in the COPA action and (b) they were members of COPA.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_54"><span class="judgment-body__number">54.</span>
      <div>
        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, it did not seem to me to be
          satisfactory to make directions in those two actions without consideration of the other two. Hence, I
          directed a further Joint CMC, this time in all four actions, which took place on 15<sup>th</sup> June
          2023. The same point occurred to Dr Wright’s team very shortly before the hearing – they wrote to Dr
          Wright’s opponents in all four actions suggesting that, since the identity issue arose in all four
          actions, it should be tried by way of preliminary issue. As a result, at that hearing there was
          considerable debate as to what should be ordered to be tried by way of preliminary issue. In the result,
          I ordered that the trial set in the COPA Action should be a Joint Trial of (a) the COPA Action and (b) a
          preliminary issue in the BTC Core Claim of the Identity Issue, namely whether Dr Wright is the
          pseudonymous ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’, i.e. the person who created Bitcoin in 2009. On agreeing to be bound by
          the result of that Joint Trial, the Coinbase and Kraken Defendants agreed to a stay of their actions. I
          also reset the timetable to trial in the COPA Action. </p>

      <div>
        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At that point, the BTC Core claim had not
          advanced very far, so the active defendants to that claim – the Developers – had a lot of work to do to
          catch up with the progress which had been made in the COPA Action. I ordered the provision to the
          Developers of the disclosure in the COPA Action, but further directions as to the involvement of the
          Developers in the Joint Trial were reserved to a later date.</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Subsequently the action brought by Tulip
          Trading Ltd against the Bitcoin Association for BSV (a Swiss Verein) and fifteen individuals (being or
          including the Developers), BL-2021-000313, was also docketed to me.</p>
