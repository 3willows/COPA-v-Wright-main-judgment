              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The general admissibility of hearsay evidence
                in civil proceedings is provided for by s.1 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995. That Act also lays the
                ground for hearsay notices (see s.2) and cross-examination on hearsay statements (see s.3). The weight
                to be given to hearsay evidence is addressed by s.4, which gives a non-exhaustive list of
                considerations:</p>
