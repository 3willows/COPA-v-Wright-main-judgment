              Wright as confirming his claim to be Satoshi as summarised under the heading to this section G (see just

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have already dismissed some of those points.
              However, taking them together, against the concrete detail of the points I have discussed in this section,
              plus all the evidence of forgery by Dr Wright, those mostly circumstantial points relied on for Dr Wright
              can have no weight. To the extent that the evidence went beyond circumstantial, I am entirely satisfied
              the relevant witness was mistaken or lying. All of them might well have been encouraged to embellish their
              evidence by Dr Wright.</p>

<section>
<p><i>’10. Dr Wright’s deeply held belief is that his identity as Satoshi should be proved through
                        work and knowledge. In summary, “you prove by knowledge, who you are, what you create” {Day
                        7/144/13-14}. In Dr Wright’s view, an important aspect of this approach to proving identity lies
                        in his extensive portfolio of patent research and development. The breadth of that portfolio is
                        not in dispute. Dr Wright was not challenged during cross-examination in relation to his
                        evidence that nChain has amassed a substantial portfolio of patents, encompassing nearly 4,000
                        patent filings, which are the fruit of Dr Wright’s prior research. {Wright 1 [172] {E/1/31}}.
                        COPA’s attempt to undermine that evidence by the back door, during cross-examination of Ms Jones
                        (without putting the equivalent points to Dr Wright), was misguided.</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, Dr Wright’s ‘work and knowledge’
              argument was yet another convenient excuse in his attempts to avoid all the highly problematic metadata
              and other indicia of forgery.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the ‘<i>extensive portfolio of patent
                research and development</i>’, Dr Wright was clear that in June 2015, he had the fruits of research but
              no patents had yet been applied for. He claimed to have a large number of research papers (some 1,300),
              each of which he claimed would give rise to multiple patents. It was not clear whether his count of patent
              filings was by patent family or individual patents. Whether all of this was exaggerated or not does not
              matter. The point is that starting from 2015, a well-funded business with a research focus could generate
              that number of patent filings, but this sheds no light whatsoever on events in 2008 and 2009. If anything,
              the generation of a multi-patent thicket which it is apparent Dr Wright (and nChain) wish to assert
              against anyone who does not share his view of Bitcoin appears to me to run entirely counter to the way
              Satoshi created and released Bitcoin as open-source material.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In closing, I asked when Dr Wright’s first
              patent application was filed. The answer came back at the start of Day 22 that his first priority document
              was filed on 28 October 2011, but the documents produced <b>{X/85 </b>and<b> X/87}</b> concerned claims to
              a registry in which entries were securely timestamped and digitally signed. Although I was not addressed
              on this document, a brief review indicated it had only a very tenuous connection to Bitcoin via the known
              concepts of timestamping and digital signing. In any event, this does not appear to have been one of the
              nChain portfolio.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Naturally, I say nothing about the validity of
              any of these patents. However, for present purposes, in my judgment there was nothing under this head to
              support Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b>The private proof sessions</b></p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘11. Dr Wright’s demonstration during a number of private proof sessions in 2016 that he was
                        in possession of private keys to certain of the original blocks (i.e. blocks 1 to 11) of the
                        Bitcoin blockchain is highly probative of his claim to be Satoshi. These sessions included
                        demonstrations with Mr Andresen and Mr Matonis, both of whom were central figures in the Bitcoin
                        community, Andrew O’Hagan, an author who was chronicling the evolution of nChain, and
                        journalists from the BBC (Rory Cellan-Jones) and Economist (Ludwig Siegele). In each
                        demonstration, Dr Wright showed he had access to private keys associated with early blocks. The
                        fact that Mr Andresen and Mr Matonis were persuaded by these demonstrations that Dr Wright was
                        Satoshi is highly significant. Their recognition of Dr Wright as Satoshi is particularly
                        credible. COPA’s attempts to undermine the integrity of the private proof sessions are
                        misplaced. There is no realistic basis for supposing that the sessions were deliberately
                        subverted by Dr Wright and any case to that effect is in any event not open to COPA on its
                        pleadings and was not fairly put to Dr Wright in cross-x.’</i></p>
