<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Courts have long recognised in cases of
                fraud the importance of testing the veracity of accounts “by reference to the objective facts proved
                independently of [witnesses’] testimony, in particular by reference to the documents in the case, and
                also to pay particular regard to their motives and to the overall probabilities”: <i>Armagas Ltd v
                  Mundogas SA (The Ocean Frost)</i> 1985 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1 at 57 (Lord Goff). It has thus, and rightly
                become a commonplace in commercial litigation that contemporaneous documents “are generally regarded as
                far more reliable than the oral evidence of witnesses, still less their demeanour while giving
                evidence”: <i>Simetra Global Assets ltd v Ikon Finance Ltd</i> [2019] 4 WLR 112 at §§48-49. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I was naturally referred to the well-known
                observations of Leggatt J in <i>Gestmin SGPS SA v Credit Suisse (UK) Ltd</i> [2013] EWHC 3560 (Comm)
                (reported at [2020] 1 CLC 428) at [15]-[22] which have been cited in many cases and which I need not
                repeat. Leggatt J. concluded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘22. In the light of these considerations, the best approach for a judge to adopt in the trial
                      of a commercial case is, in my view, to place little if any reliance at all on witnesses’
                      recollections of what was said in meetings and conversations, and to base factual findings on
                      inferences drawn from the documentary evidence and known or probable facts. This does not mean
                      that oral testimony serves no useful purpose – though its utility is often disproportionate to its
                      length. But its value lies largely, as I see it, in the opportunity which cross-examination
                      affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality,
                      motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness
                      recalls of particular conversations and events. Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of
                      supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest,
                      evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth.’</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the circumstances of this case, it is
                important to point out that the Court must be satisfied that the purportedly contemporaneous documents
                are <i>reliable</i>. If any of the purportedly contemporaneous documents are alleged to be forged, these
                allegations add an extra layer of complexity to the assessment of the evidence.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I also found some recent observations of Rajah
                J. helpful from his Judgment in <i>South Tees Development Corporation v PD Teesport Ltd </i>[2024] EWHC
                214 (Ch), a case where the numerous witnesses were recollecting/trying to recollect, against an
                incomplete documentary record, uses of various rights of way dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. In the
                context of setting out [15]-[20] of <i>Gestmin, </i>Rajah J observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘23. …  Memory plays tricks on people. It is perfectly possible for an honest witness to have a
                      firm memory of events which they believe to be true, but which in fact is not correct.</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Although Leggatt J’s words have been
                        sometimes taken as an encouragement to place no reliance on witness recollection, particularly
                        when there is an abundance of reliable contemporaneous documentation, the Court of Appeal has
                        confirmed that the assessment of the credibility of a witness’ evidence should be a part of a
                        single compendious exercise of finding the facts based on all of the available evidence;
                        see <span style="font-style:normal">Kogan v Martin</span> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/1645"><span style="color:initial"><u>[2019] EWCA Civ 1645</u></span></a> and <span style="font-style:normal">Natwest Markets Plc, Mercuria Energy Europe Trading v Bilta (UK) Ltd
                          (In Liquidation)</span> <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/680"><span style="color:initial"><u>[2021] EWCA Civ 680</u></span></a> at paragraphs 50 and 51.</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Each witness’s evidence has to be
                        weighed in the context of the reliably established facts (including those which can safely be
                        distilled from contemporaneous documentation bearing in mind that the documentation itself may
                        be unreliable or incomplete), the motives and biases in play, the possible unreliability or
                        corruption of human memory and the inherent probabilities. Where there is reliable
                        contemporaneous documentation, it will be natural to place weight on that. Where documents add
                        little to the analysis, other secure footholds in the evidence need, if possible, to be found to
                        decide whether it is more likely than not that the witness’ memory is reliable or mistaken.’</i>
