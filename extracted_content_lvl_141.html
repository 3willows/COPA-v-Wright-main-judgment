              Wright’s first public reference to Bitcoin. To set the scene it is necessary to go back to a thread
              started by a user called genjix on bitcoin.org in November 2010 about using Bitcoin to make payments to
              Wikileaks. Robert Horning responded in a lengthy post <b>{L19/168/35} </b>concluding with the suggestion:
              “<i>Basically, bring it on. Let's encourage Wikileaks to use Bitcoins and I'm willing to face any risk or
                fallout from that act</i>”. Satoshi Nakamoto responded to that suggestion on 5 December 2010
              <b>{L19/168/49}</b>, stating:</p>

              Satoshi’s response on 11 December 2010 at <b>{L19/49/2}</b>, which was one of his final postings on the

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s first public reference to Bitcoin
              was on 28 July 2011. It was a response to some comments posted on an article that he had published for an
              online media outlet known as The Conversation. The article, entitled “<i>Are Anonymous and LulzSec about
                to hack PayPal for WikiLeaks?</i>”, questioned whether PayPal’s decision to withhold funds from
              WikiLeaks might lead to it being hacked.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the comments beneath the article Dr Wright
              advanced the argument that, as a business, PayPal was entitled not to transact with WikiLeaks. Some of the
              commenters challenged that view on the basis that WikiLeaks did not have an alternative payment provider.
              Dr Wright observed that he knew of over 50 alternatives to PayPal and that WikiLeaks could have selected
              “<i>BitCoin</i>”, but it did not. He noted that “<i>If you want to look at anything to blame, look to WL’s
                stupidity in selecting PayPal as a provider over BitCoin and others like them when PayPal is known to
                shy away from contraversy [sic]</i>”.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright wrote a follow-up piece for the same
              website on 9 August 2011 entitled “<i>LulzSec, Anonymous … freedom fighters or the new face of evil?</i>”
              in which he referred to the vandalization by Anonymous of the home page of the Syrian Ministry of Defence.
              Dr Wright turned the conversation back to the position of PayPal, who he suggested represented freedom far
              more than groups such as LulzSec and Anonymous.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the point about whether there were sufficient
              alternatives to PayPal he argued that there were. He responded to one commenter stating that “<i>WikiLeaks
                can get payments from other sources. It CAN get money transfers. It can get </i><i><u>bit
                  coins</u></i><i> it can do many things if it wants. There are MANY options that allow people to send
                money to WL</i>” (emphasis added) <b>{L7/391/13</b>}. He responded to another commenter as follows

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that Dr Wright’s first public foray
                  into Bitcoin took a diametrically opposing view to Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi was seeking to discourage
                  Wikileaks from adopting Bitcoin. Dr Wright seemed to think this would be a good idea.</p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, that by late July 2011 Dr Wright was
                  aware of Bitcoin but he was uncertain about how it was spelled. On whether it should be one word or
                  two, Dr Wright suggested in cross-examination that his use of two words was the consequence of
                  auto-correct but this explanation is unconvincing in view of the fact that the ‘error’ appears three
                  times in just 10 words in his post at <b>{L7/391/17-18}</b> – the point being that he was bound to
                  spot the ‘error’ if he had meant to write a single word, whether BitCoin or Bitcoin. </p>

              <div>
                <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On whether the c of coin should be
                  capitalised or not, the Developers pointed out that the first release of Bitcoin was accompanied by a
                  readme.txt file which referred to BitCoin. However, Satoshi Nakamoto moved the content of that readme
                  file to build-unix.txt on 5 November 2009, see https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/32/, in which
                  the equivalent text referred to Bitcoin (without a capital “C”). All further releases of the Bitcoin
                  Software referred to Bitcoin without capitalising the “C”.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In July 2011, there is no reason to believe that
              Satoshi would have reversed his original view, having only relinquished his use of the pseudonym in April
              2011. Furthermore, Satoshi would have had no reason to use any expressions other than ‘Bitcoin’. He would
              not have used two words or capitalised the C. I also agree with the Developers that these posts show that
              Dr Wright had no significant familiarity with Bitcoin in July 2011, and that it is reasonable to suppose
              that all his familiarity was gained subsequently by careful study of the materials which had been made
              public. </p>
