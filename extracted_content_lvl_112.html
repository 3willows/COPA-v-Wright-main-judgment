<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In cross-examination, Counsel for COPA put to Dr
        Wright that his working history was as ‘<i>the IT security services guy’</i> <b>{Day5/177:1}</b> -
        <b>{Day5/178:1}</b>, and in submissions Counsel acknowledged that Dr Wright had taken great umbrage at
        this. These points were based on the following submissions, themselves based on passages in
        <b>Wright1</b>, his 2007 CV at <b>{L2/102/4}</b> and his 2015 LinkedIn profile at <b>{L11/130/16}</b>.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel submitted that however competent Dr
        Wright may have been at IT security, he was not a visionary working at the cutting edge of designing
        digital payment systems. I summarised Dr Wright’s employment prior to 2009 earlier (see [26]-[32] above).

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA submitted that Dr Wright’s claims of
        creating early versions of the Bitcoin system in timestamp servers for Lasseter’s were not supported by
        any documents or by the evidence of Mr Archbold. I agree.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As COPA submitted, Dr Wright’s actual activities
        from 2007 to early 2009 did not give him a lot of time to work on developing a revolutionary new means of
        exchange and speculation. He had a full-time job for almost the entire time. He was working on his LLM
        (including assignments and a 90-page dissertation), an MStat course and a third master’s degree. He was
        working towards a series of IT security qualifications. He posted 269 blog articles in 2008 alone. He
        prepared several chapters for a book on IT compliance, as well as working on other books. With David
        Kleiman and Shyaam Sundhar, he completed a long paper on overwriting hard drive data, which he said in a
        blog “<i>ate 18 months of my life</i>” {see <b>{Day6/35:25} - {Day6/38:11}}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Despite his life and his professional and
        academic interests being extensively documented in the blog posts and papers referred to above, there is
        no evidence of him doing any work or study on digital cash or even digital payment systems over this
        period. </p>

        evidence to suggest that Dr Wright is not Satoshi.</p>

<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘4. Dr Wright has been deeply invested in the evolution of digital cash systems since the
                  early 1990s. Examples include: his work at OzEmail, which involved the development of a payment
                  protocol called “Millicent” that “used digital signatures” and an analogous scripting language
                  to Bitcoin {Day 5/166/9 to 168/2}; and his work at DeMorgan, which involved extensive research
                  and development in digital cash. The latter included project ‘BlackNet’, which Dr Wright
                  described as “an encrypted internet based on crypto credits” that “morphed into Bitcoin and
                  Metanet” {Day 5/171/17 to 173/11}.</i></p>
