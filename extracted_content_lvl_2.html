<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_1"><span class="judgment-body__number">1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Craig Steven Wright (‘Dr Wright’) claims to
          be Satoshi Nakamoto i.e. he claims to be the person who adopted that pseudonym, who wrote and published
          the first version of the Bitcoin White Paper on 31 October 2008, who wrote and released the first
          version of the Bitcoin Source Code and who created the Bitcoin system. Dr Wright also claims to be a
          person with a unique intellect, with numerous degrees and PhDs in a wide range of subjects, the unique
          combination of which led him (so it is said) to devise the Bitcoin system.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_2"><span class="judgment-body__number">2.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thus, Dr Wright presents himself as an
          extremely clever person. However, in my judgment, he is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is. In both
          his written evidence and in days of oral evidence under cross-examination, I am entirely satisfied that
          Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly. Most of his lies related to the documents he had
          forged which purported to support his claim. All his lies and forged documents were in support of his
          biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_3"><span class="judgment-body__number">3.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Many of Dr Wright’s lies contained a grain of
          truth (which is sometimes said to be the mark of an accomplished liar), but there were many which did
          not and were outright lies. As soon as one lie was exposed, Dr Wright resorted to further lies and
          evasions. The final destination frequently turned out to be either Dr Wright blaming some other (often
          unidentified) person for his predicament or what can only be described as technobabble delivered by him
          in the witness box. Although as a person with expertise in IT security, Dr Wright must have thought his
          forgeries would provide convincing evidence to support his claim to be Satoshi or some other point of
          detail and would go undetected, the evidence shows, as I explain below and in the Appendix, that most of
          his forgeries turned out to be clumsy. Indeed, certain of Dr Wright’s responses in cross-examination
          effectively acknowledged that point: from my recollection at least twice he indicated if he had wanted
          to forge a document, he would have done a much better job. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_4"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If Dr Wright’s evidence was true, he would be
          a uniquely unfortunate individual, the victim of a very large number of unfortunate coincidences, all of
          which went against him, and/or the victim of a number of conspiracies against him.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_5"><span class="judgment-body__number">5.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The true position is far simpler. It is,
          however, far from simple because Dr Wright has lied so much over so many years that, on certain points,
          it can be difficult to pinpoint what actually happened. Those difficulties do not detract from the fact
          that there is a very considerable body of evidence against Dr Wright being Satoshi. To the extent that
          it is said there is evidence supporting his claim, it is at best questionable or of very dubious
          relevance or entirely circumstantial and at worst, it is fabricated and/or based on documents I am
          satisfied have been forged on a grand scale by Dr Wright. These fabrications and forgeries were exposed
          in the evidence which I received during the Trial. For that reason, this Judgment contains considerable
          technical and other detail which is required to expose the true scale of his mendacious campaign to
          prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto. This detail was set out in the extensive Written Closing Submissions
          prepared by COPA and the Developers and further points drawn out in their oral closing arguments.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_6"><span class="judgment-body__number">6.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At the same time, it is right to record that
          Counsel for Dr Wright put forward the best case which could possibly be presented for Dr Wright in their
          written and oral closing submissions, constrained as they were by the evidence I heard in this Trial.

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, at the conclusion of closing
          submissions I felt able to and did announce the result of the Identity Issue, namely whether Dr Wright
          is the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto i.e. the person who created Bitcoin in 2009. Having considered all
          the evidence and submissions presented to me during the Trial, I reached the conclusion the evidence was
          overwhelming. At that point, I made certain declarations (because I was satisfied they are useful and
          are necessary to do justice between the parties), as follows:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">7.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that Dr Wright is not the author of
              the Bitcoin White Paper.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, Dr Wright is not the person who
              adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period between 2008 and 2011.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, Dr Wright is not the person who
              created the Bitcoin system.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_8"><span class="judgment-body__number">8.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I also indicated that any further relief would
          be dealt with in my written Judgment (to the extent possible). I extended time for filing any
          appellant’s notice until 21 days after the form of order hearing to be appointed following the hand down
          of this Judgment. I made an Order to give effect to what I stated at the conclusion of the closing
          argument, which contains the above declarations and directions. Finally, I stated I would give my
          detailed reasons in a written Judgment which would be handed down at a later date. This is that Judgment
          containing my detailed reasoning.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_9"><span class="judgment-body__number">9.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should point out that the conclusion I
          reached and explain in this Judgment is the product of a highly iterative process. I have had regard to
          a very large number of pieces of evidence. Each piece had and has to be evaluated on its merits but also
          in the context of what other pieces of evidence appear to show. The period between the conclusion of the
          evidence and receipt of the lengthy Written Closing Submissions, along with my detailed consideration of
          the written and oral closing arguments, allowed me to reflect on the totality of the evidence. It is
          true that most of the evidence has concerned COPA’s allegations of forgery. Ultimately, those
          allegations are just one factor which I took into account in reaching my overall conclusion. It was
          essential to step back from all the detail, to identify the various factors which supported Dr Wright’s
          claim to be Satoshi and those which went against it.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_10"><span class="judgment-body__number">10.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Satoshi Nakamoto was and remains a pseudonym.
          Although this is not of any significant weight in my overall conclusion, my personal view, having heard
          all the evidence in this Trial, is that it is likely that a number of people contributed to the creation
          of Bitcoin, albeit that there may well have been one central individual. It would therefore be accurate
          to refer to Satoshi as he/she/they to reflect the possibilities, but unwieldy. I will therefore refer to
          Satoshi simply as ‘he’, but it is a shorthand for he/she/they.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Here I summarise the competing factors,
          starting with the factors which are alleged to support Dr Wright’s claim to be Satoshi:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His unique combination of skills,

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is relevant to point out that all of these
          factors are significantly affected not only by COPA’s allegations of forgery but also the evidence of a
          large number of witnesses called by COPA who I judge to have given entirely independent and unbiased
          evidence.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_13"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the factors against Dr Wright being
          Satoshi, I divided these into two categories:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">13.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, the attributes and behaviour which
              one would expect Satoshi to exhibit and prove (on the assumption that he would set out to prove he
              was Satoshi – on which see below), and those he would not. Under this head, the principal points
              are:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.1.1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Satoshi would be most unlikely
                  to have any real difficulty in proving he was Satoshi. For example, he would be able to present
                  some insight or knowledge from the very early materials which no-one but the creator of Bitcoin
                  would know – perhaps something hidden in the Genesis block. Or he would have been able to
                  transfer Bitcoin out of some of the very early blocks which are generally accepted to have been
                  mined by Satoshi, to prove that he owned those Bitcoin. He would not have lost every private key
                  to those early blocks.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.1.2.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, I do not believe that Satoshi
                  would ever have resorted to forgery in his attempt to prove he was Satoshi. He would not have
                  backdated documents or altered the clock on his computer(s), for the simple reason that there
                  was and is no need for him to do so. (For completeness I add that, in the very unlikely event
                  that he did engage in some forgery, upon that being discovered, he would own up and explain why
                  it was he had been driven to forgery. He would not have engaged in yet more forgery or engaged
                  in technobabble in his attempts to justify it).</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.1.3.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, the contemporaneous materials
                  written by Satoshi, including the White Paper, the posts and his email exchanges with
                  individuals, convey an impression of a calm, knowledgeable, collaborative, precise person with
                  little or no arrogance, willing to acknowledge and implement ideas and suggestions from others
                  who had shown an interest in Bitcoin.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.1.4.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, due to his collaborative and
                  non-confrontational nature, I consider it is most unlikely that Satoshi would ever have resorted
                  to litigation against the Developers. Satoshi would have recognised that differences in views
                  led to the hard forks in the Bitcoin Blockchain and moved on.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">13.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second and by contrast, the attributes and
              behaviours which Dr Wright has exhibited and which were proved to my satisfaction in this Trial:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.2.1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright is an individual with some
                  strong views about Bitcoin and details of its implementation. However, I was struck by the fact
                  that all of his knowledge and supposed insights could well have been obtained by careful study
                  of the publicly available materials relating to the early years of Bitcoin. In my judgment, in
                  none of his evidence did he reveal any insight or knowledge unique to Satoshi.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.2.2.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore, in his evidence, Dr
                  Wright made significant errors which Satoshi would never have made, even after this length of
                  time. Some of these relate to Satoshi’s interactions with individuals not previously made
                  public. Others relate to technical matters which Dr Wright simply got wrong but which Satoshi
                  would not have got wrong.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.2.3.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright has had many years to
                  prepare to prove that he was/is Satoshi. I have concluded (in the detailed findings I make below
                  and in the Appendix) that, as he faced greater and more significant challenges to his claim, he
                  took his lies and forgery to ever greater levels. I explain this in much greater detail below.
                </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.2.4.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The picture painted by Dr Wright in
                  his evidence was, in essence, that he was solely responsible for creating Bitcoin, that he was
                  much cleverer than anyone else, that anyone who questioned his claim or his evidence was not
                  qualified to do so or just didn’t understand what he was saying. In my judgment, the arrogance
                  he displayed was at odds with what comes through from Satoshi’s writing. In short, in his
                  writing and attitude Dr Wright just doesn’t sound or act like Satoshi.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_14"><span class="judgment-body__number">14.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ultimately, I consider it is likely that the
          real Satoshi would never have set out to prove in litigation that he actually was Satoshi and certainly
          not in the way that Dr Wright attempted to do so.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_15"><span class="judgment-body__number">15.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I recognise that Dr Wright will disagree with
          my findings and this Judgment and, true to the form he displayed on numerous occasions during his oral
          evidence as regards the expert evidence, he may well allege that I didn’t understand his technical
          explanations or other aspects of the technology. There are perhaps four main points to note in response:
        </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">15.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, to the extent that I have made
              errors, the Court of Appeal is well qualified (a) to detect them and (b) to correct them.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, the technology involved in his
              case is not particularly complex or difficult to understand (compared with some of the Patent cases
              I have dealt with). Indeed, the more complex areas of technology in this case did not concern
              Bitcoin or cryptography but the evidence which exposed his forgeries.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">15.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, if he does make such accusations, I
              will remain reassured that I am in good company, along with the experts who gave evidence in this
              case, both those instructed by COPA and those instructed by Dr Wright’s team.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">15.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, this Trial was Dr Wright’s
              opportunity to explain everything, to make his technical explanations clear to me. He had the
              benefit of numerous procedural indulgences regarding disclosure and additional evidence.
              Furthermore, on more than one occasion during his cross-examination, I made it clear that it was
              important he ensured I understood the point he was trying to make. I was left with the clear
              impression that he simply engaged in technobabble precisely because he was not able to put forward
              any coherent explanation for the forgeries which had been exposed, and yet he could not bring
              himself to accept that he was responsible for them.</p>
