<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright first claimed to have operated a large
              number of computers (67) at his home in Australia at the start of the Bitcoin system in a blog on 6 April
              2019 <b>{L14/420/2}</b> and in a CoinGeek interview on 6 June 2019 <b>{O4/12/13}</b> (this time with 69
              machines). These claims were expanded upon in his evidence-in-chief in the <i>Kleiman</i> proceedings
              <b>{L17/327/105}-{L17/327/108</b>}. He suggested there that he was running 69 machines in four racks
              spread over his homes in Lisarow and Bagnoo at a monthly electricity cost of AU$11,000. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At <b>Wright1 [116] {E/1/22} </b>he appeared to
              suggest that he was in fact running 69 racks at those residences, but explained in cross-examination by
              COPA that he meant 69 computers in racks. At <b>Wright1 [117]</b> {E/1/22} he nevertheless went on to say
              that the “<i>considerable electricity consumption associated with Bitcoin mining represented a significant
                expense for me, amounting to thousands of Australian dollars</i>” and confirmed in cross-examination
              that he stood by the figures stated in <i>Kleiman</i>.</p>
