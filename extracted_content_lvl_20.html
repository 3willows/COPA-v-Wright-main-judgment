<p><u>Burden and Standard of Proof</u></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The general rule is that the legal burden lies
                upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the relevant issue: <i>Phipson On
                  Evidence</i> 19th Ed, at [6-06]. However, in deciding which party substantially asserts the
                affirmative, regard must be had to the substance of the issue and not merely to its grammatical form. It
                is also said that in a civil action, the burden of proof rests on the party who “<i>asserts a
                  proposition of fact which is not self-evident”:</i> see <i>Robins v National Trust Company Ltd</i>
                [1927] AC 515 at 520. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The true meaning of the general rule,
                therefore, is that where “a given allegation, whether positive or negative, forms an essential part of a
                party’s case, the proof of such allegations rests upon them”: see <i>Emmanuel v Avison</i> [2020] EWHC
                1696 (Ch) at §54. Another way to approach the same question is to posit the striking out of the
                particular allegation and ask which party’s case would fail as a result (the legal burden being borne by
                that party). </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Joint Trial is the main trial of COPA’s
                claim for, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
                An essential (and necessary) part of that claim is COPA’s allegation that Dr Wright is indeed not the
                author of the Bitcoin White Paper/ Satoshi Nakamoto. Put another way, COPA’s claim for that declaration
                would fail if its allegations as to Dr Wright’s identity were struck out. It follows that COPA bears the
                legal burden of proving those allegations (which includes the legal burden of proving its forgery
                allegations). </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_104"><span class="judgment-body__number">104.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is common ground that COPA bears the burden
                of proving its entitlement, as a matter of law, to the declaratory (and other) relief it seeks.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_105"><span class="judgment-body__number">105.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, the Joint Trial is also the
                preliminary issue trial of the Identity Issue in the BTC Core Claim. Dr Wright is in that case asserting
                his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto as an essential part of his claim for injunctions and a declaration. Dr
                Wright therefore accepts that he bears the legal burden in respect of the Identity Issue in the BTC Core
                Claim. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The result of this procedural arrangement is
                that (1) in the COPA Claim, in order to obtain the relief it seeks, COPA must prove, on the balance of
                probabilities, that Dr Wright is <u>not</u> Satoshi Nakamoto; but (2) in order to succeed in due course
                in the BTC Core Claim (and in the other cases where the parties are bound by the result of this Trial),
                Dr Wright must have proved in this Joint Trial that he is, on the balance of probabilities, Satoshi
                Nakamoto. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In general, a Court ought to attempt to make
                positive findings of fact on disputed issues if it is able to do so. The Court will only resolve an
                issue by resort to the burden of proof in the “<i>exceptional situation</i>” where “<i>notwithstanding
                  that it has striven to do so, it cannot reasonably make a finding in relation to a disputed
                  issue</i>”: <i>Stephens v Cannon</i> [2005] CP Rep 31 (CA) at §§37-46] <i>Verlander v Devon Waste
                  Management</i> [2007] EWCA Civ 835 at §24. “<i>Choosing between conflicting factual and expert
                  evidence is a primary judicial function</i>” and “<i>the judge’s task is generally to decide the case
                  by choosing one over the other</i>”: <i>Lysandrou v Lysandrou</i> [2018] EWCA Civ 613 at §29.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The standard of proof applying to all factual
                issues in civil proceedings is the balance of probabilities. It applies equally to allegations which
                amount to criminal conduct: see <i>Phipson on Evidence (20</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> ed.)</i> at §6-57.
                It is not a flexible or sliding standard. In applying the standard, a Court may where appropriate take
                account of the inherent probability of particularly serious allegations: see <i>Re H (Minors)</i> [1996]
                AC 563 at 586. However, there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and
                its inherent probability, as Lord Hoffmann explained in <i>Re B (Children)</i> [2009] 1 AC 11 at §15:
              </p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>“There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved
                      to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this
                      question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a
                      child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most
                      parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other
                      compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It
                      would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is
                      unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too
                      likely.”</i></p>

<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>“Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make
                      any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent
                      probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the
                      truth lies.”</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Where a story involves a sequence of events,
                each of which is independently improbable, there is substantial authority that the Court should have
                regard to the cumulative effect, which may support an alternative conclusion: see <i>Suez Fortune
                  Investments Ltd v Talbot Underwriting Ltd (“Brillante Virtuoso”)</i> [2019] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 485 at
