<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The concept of an unsigned integer is simple: it
              cannot be negative. Satoshi often used unsigned integers in the Bitcoin code, he commonly referenced them
              in his emails and they are used in the Bitcoin File Format (the subject of alleged copyright which Dr
              Wright claims to have authored). Searches undertaken by the Developers indicate they were used 294 times
              across the entirety of the original Bitcoin code and over 100 times in the original main.cpp, main.h and
              bignum.h. Their point was that Satoshi would not have forgotten what an unsigned integer was, even after
              15 years.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In a striking passage of cross-examination, Dr
              Wright was unable to explain the concept (at least until after he was taken to ‘C++ for Dummies’). He was
              taken to the script.h file and to the declaration of a constant integer variable called
              <i>MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE. </i>The cross-examination proceeded as follows:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Some of the pauses are indicated in the
              transcript but on being invited to take a wild guess, there was a long pause (of about 8 seconds, albeit
              not referenced in one version of the transcript) before Dr Wright started his answer (a strong contrast
              with his usual immediate answer to any question).</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bearing in mind the care, effort and skill which
              Satoshi used in writing the Bitcoin Source Code, I agree that Satoshi would not have had any difficulty in
              explaining the concept of an unsigned integer, even 15 years later. Accordingly, I agree with the
              Developers that this evidence indicates that Dr Wright did not write the Bitcoin Source Code. Furthermore,
              this was a legitimate point on which to cross-examine, bearing in mind Dr Wright’s much vaunted expertise
              in coding in C++, which he claimed still to be current. This claim has turned out to be one of many made
              by Dr Wright in this litigation which have common characteristics. A claim is made that he has a special
              (even unique) skill, knowledge or experience. The claim appears to be supported by some detail from the
              past which it is very difficult, if not impossible, to check or disprove, often because the detail is
              known only to him. Dr Wright is well aware of this. When he is challenged, he usually has some additional
              explanation which often involves some technical matters (which again are difficult or impossible to check
              or disprove during cross-examination). The claim is often either exaggerated or misleading or is simply
              untrue.</p>
