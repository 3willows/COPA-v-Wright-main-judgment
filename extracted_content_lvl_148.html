<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Around early March 2016, Dr Wright performed two
        private demonstrations for Andrew O’Hagan during which he said that he had used the private key from one
        of the original blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain which were associated with Satoshi. This is said to have
        been a dry run for demonstrations to be carried out for Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen (both subject to
        NDAs). Dr Wright says that the first demonstration took place in an apartment near Soho where he was
        staying and the second took place at his then home in Wimbledon.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Jon Matonis met Dr Wright in mid-March 2016 in a
        hotel in Covent Garden, as arranged by Mr MacGregor and Mr Matthews. Dr Wright then met Mr Andresen in
        London on or about 7 April 2016, having briefly corresponded by email. Again, they met in a hotel, and Mr
        MacGregor and Mr Matthews were present. For this session, Dr Wright claims a new IBM ThinkPad laptop was
        purchased from a retail store by an assistant for the demonstration. Dr Wright claims to have signed
        messages using the keys associated with blocks 1 and 9. As noted below in relation to the signing
        sessions, there are some differences between Dr Wright’s recollection and that of Mr Andresen in his
        <i>Kleiman</i> deposition (the latter given with reference to some notes). Based on the agreed expert
        evidence, these are important to whether the session was genuine.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Towards the end of April 2016, Dr Wright met
        Rory Cellan-Jones of the BBC. At this meeting, Dr Wright claims to have demonstrated possession of keys
        from among the first blocks, including block 9. Dr Wright also met with Ludwig Siegele from the Economist
        and, similarly, claims to have demonstrated using private keys, including for blocks 1 and 9, to sign
        messages. Dr Wright was then interviewed by Stuart McGurk from GQ, with the reporter being accompanied by
        a cryptologist, Dr Nicolas Courtois. Dr Wright said he cannot “<i>recall the demonstrations exactly</i>”
        that were made to the journalists. However, he did say that he did at least demonstrate possession of the
        private key associated with block 9 in all his signing sessions {<b>Wright2 [24], [32] &amp; [40]</b>}.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These signing sessions with the journalists were
        arranged by Mr MacGregor and Mr Matthews together. In his first witness statement, Mr Matthews had denied
        his involvement in public proof sessions, but then had to qualify his position after being shown the
        series of emails where he was shown to be making arrangements. He admitted that he had performed a series
        of tasks of setting up the public sessions and making them go smoothly but denied that these involved
        “arranging” the sessions.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By mid-to-late April 2016, there was a plan in
        place for Dr Wright to sign a message with one of the keys linked to early Bitcoin blocks associated with
        Satoshi, and for him to post that signed message on his blog as part of the Big Reveal. Mr Matthews
        accepted, grudgingly, that there was such a plan in place. After some pressing, he accepted that, as he
        understood it at the time, the draft blog post was supposed to be providing a cryptographic proof.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Matthews tried in cross-examination to say
        that he was just going along with Mr MacGregor and that there was a conceptual divide between Mr MacGregor
        and Dr Wright. However, as set out above, the emails from that time tell a different story and show
        nothing of the supposed aggression which Dr Wright and Mr Matthews attempt to attribute to Mr MacGregor.
        Mr Matthews accepted this but said that the large number of emails did not represent the true picture of
        the relationships.</p>
