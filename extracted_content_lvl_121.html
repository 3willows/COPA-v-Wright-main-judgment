<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers’ third point concerned the change
              (and improvement) in the proof-of-work system between what was proposed in section 4 of the Bitcoin White
              Paper and what Satoshi implemented in the original Bitcoin Source Code. This point is closely related to
              challenges made by COPA to parts of Dr Wright’s evidence about the proof-of-work mechanism that he (as
              Satoshi) designed in the Bitcoin system and his interactions with Wei Dai and Dr Adam Back. It also
              relates to the counter-challenge by Dr Wright to Dr Back’s evidence. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright1</b>, Dr Wright described those
              interactions in these paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘91. In August 2008 1 reached out to a small number of individuals, including Wei Dai and Adam
                    Back, by sharing the link to the White Paper via email as Satoshi Nakamoto, most likely using my
                    satoshi@anonymousspeech.com address. I sent them a link to upload.ae where I had uploaded a single
                    draft of the White Paper. …</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Wei Dai was a distinguished academic
                      who had previously proposed a digital currency concept called B-Money, which profoundly impacted
                      my thinking. His work was highly influential and laid the groundwork for some ideas incorporated
                      into the Bitcoin project. Notably, Wei Dai's contributions were the first that I acknowledged in
                      the White Paper. After I provided him with a copy of the White Paper, he played a significant role
                      in the development process, guiding me to various signature algorithm libraries, including his
                      secure hash algorithm {SHA-256), which I successfully incorporated into the Bitcoin code base.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Adam Back was known for his work on
                      Hashcash (a proof-of-work algorithm different to that in bitcoin which he had proposed to combat
                      email spam). He showed little interest in Bitcoin. His attitude was quite dismissive; he stated
                      that digital cash had been attempted before and was bound to fail. At the time, I did not
                      understand he was pointing at issues associated with creating a cryptocurrency and not digital
                      cash. </i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin's
                      proof-of-work system does not utilise Adam Back's Hashcash system. Instead, it more closely aligns
                      with the methodologies described in Aura's paper. Due to Aura's lack of response, I felt it
                      necessary to reference Adam Back in the Bitcoin White Paper due to the thematic parallels in our
                      work and Back's notable presence in the field.’</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the reasons which follow, this was all made
              up by Dr Wright, even though <i>some </i>of the technical details may have had some substance. These
              paragraphs appear to represent his deduction as to what happened, based on his study of the Bitcoin White
              Paper, the references in it and his other researches (e.g. into the earlier paper by Tuomas Aura et al).
              His deduction is wrong in a number of important respects. Satoshi would not have got these points wrong.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Understandably, COPA gathered various pieces of
              evidence to dispute these paragraphs in Wright1. I deal with several topics in turn.</p>
