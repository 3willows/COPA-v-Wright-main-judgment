<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, I am able to place very little or no
              weight on the beliefs expressed by these witnesses (whether individually or collectively) that Dr Wright
              is Satoshi, principally because none of them had specific enough information to be able to express
              anything like a persuasive or definitive view. Further, none of them had access to the wealth of detailed
              information which was presented to me in this Trial. So, although I do not discount their evidence
              entirely, I must weigh their subjective opinions against the considerable quantity of evidence of
              objective fact which I heard.</p>
