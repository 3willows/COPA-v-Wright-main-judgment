<p><i>Conclusions on the private signing sessions</i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is clear that Dr Wright never publicly
        undertook a signing session or publicly posted a signature that would prove his possession of any of the
        keys associated with Satoshi. What he instead sought to do was conduct such sessions behind closed doors,
        with selected individuals who signed non-disclosure agreements (Mr Matonis, Mr Andresen and a few
        journalists). Prof Meiklejohn concluded: “<i>In my view, the evidence provided in the signing sessions
          cannot be considered as reliable in establishing possession of the private key(s) corresponding to the
          public key(s) used</i>”. In the Joint Statement, Mr Gao agreed with almost all parts of Prof
        Meiklejohn’s report concerning the signing sessions, including with that conclusion.<sup> </sup> As Prof
        Meiklejohn explained, the signing sessions omitted key steps which would have been required to make them
        reliable. All these matters remained common ground between the experts in their oral evidence.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore, there were numerous flaws in the
        signing sessions which were conducted. For those with Mr Matonis and the journalists, Dr Wright used just
        his own laptop and adopted a method which would have been very easy to fake. The session with Mr Andresen
        was a little different, because he insisted on verification being performed on a computer other than Dr
        Wright’s own. However, Mr Andresen’s evidence in <i>Kleiman</i>, which was given with reference to earlier
        notes, makes clear that various steps were not taken to ensure reliability of the session. Furthermore, it
        is striking that Dr Wright’s evidence disagrees with Mr Andresen’s on precisely those critical points.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright2</b>, Dr Wright gave a complex
        explanation of the signing sessions, setting out various technical measures he took. Professor Meiklejohn
        disagreed with a number of technical points Dr Wright made:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">850.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright said that the first stage in
            verification entails installing the Bitcoin Core software. Prof Meiklejohn explained that that
            software was not needed in relation to the keys which were to be signed, because the relevant coin
            generation transactions for the early blocks were P2PK transactions so that they contained the full
            public keys.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">850.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright claimed that he underwent the
            time-consuming exercise of downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain as a preliminary to each signing
            session. Professor Meiklejohn explained that this was unnecessary. For a reliable signing, all one
            requires are the relevant keys or addresses and message. Downloading the blockchain is time-intensive
            and does not bolster the security of the process. This was agreed by Mr Gao.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">850.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright said that, for the signing
            sessions with Mr Matonis and the journalists, he had a single laptop but used the Windows laptop
            itself for signing and a virtual machine running Linux for verification. He added that this element
            was “essential” for integrity of the exercise. Prof Meiklejohn explained that that was unnecessary and
            added nothing to the reliability of the exercise, since it is only the verification setting that needs
            to be assured to avoid corruption falsely indicating success. Again, there was no dispute about this
            between the experts.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">850.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright insisted that the procedure he
            used, with a second system or computer used for verification, avoided the risk of exposing the private
            key. Prof Meiklejohn disputed that this procedure has such a benefit over other methods. Importantly,
            she explained that one can give out a signature freely and let somebody else verify it on their
            computer without any risk of compromising the private key. Mr Gao agreed in his evidence. This shows
            that Dr Wright adopted complex methods based on a spurious risk of key compromise, when all he needed
            to do was sign a message with the private key relating to an identified block and hand over the
            signature.</p>
