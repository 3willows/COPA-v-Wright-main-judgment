<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Bitcoin folder disclosed by Dr Wright
              contains a subfolder entitled “Images” which contains the seven images from the Bitcoin White Paper in two
              formats. They were stored as .tex files in which specific drawing commands were entered in LaTeX code: see
              e.g. <b>{L21/22.2}</b>. In addition, they were provided as PDF files. As described at paragraph 481.4
              above, Dr Wright ultimately used the PDF files in his production of the White Paper LaTeX Files.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright placed specific and elaborate emphasis
              on the images in his White Paper LaTeX Files as a particularly strong indicator of the probative
              significance of those files. It is necessary first to draw attention to that evidence, before exploring
              the evidence that they were produced by Dr Wright using an online PDF-LaTeX conversion tool called Aspose.

              which Dr Wright made in the production of Image 4 in his White Paper LaTeX Files. </p>
