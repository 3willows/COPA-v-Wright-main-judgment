<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright11</b>, Dr Wright provided a lengthy
              critique of changes supposedly made “<i>by BTC</i>” to the original version of Bitcoin {<b>Wright11 [544]
                {CSW/1/100}</b>}. In particular, he complained that many “<i>OP_codes</i> <i>that are important to the
                functioning of the script have been disabled</i>” {<b>Wright11 [545] {CSW/1/100}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s inconsistent and misspelling of the
              term “opcode” {see <b>Wuille2 [13] {C1/2/3}</b>} was a small indicator that he was expounding on something
              outside his knowledge or experience. More significantly, however, it appears that when Dr Wright prepared
              and filed <b>Wright11</b> he was not aware that the relevant changes to the Bitcoin code had been made by
              Satoshi Nakamoto. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers relied on two examples of changes
              implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto namely (i) the change to size of data elements inside script and (ii) the
              disabling of OP_2MUL.</p>
