<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the most part, Dr Wright’s positive case (as
              set out in sections II-IV of his Written Closing) did not pay any attention to COPA’s numerous forgery
              allegations, no doubt because his position is that they were unfounded. For that reason, in their Written
              Closing, Counsel for Dr Wright turned to COPA’s forgery allegations in section V and they raised a series
              of important general points which I address here. I emphasise that I have taken these points into
              consideration when making my findings in the Appendix.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, I was reminded that COPA’s forgery
              allegations are not a freestanding part of COPA’s claim and they are ultimately sub-issues to the broader
              Identity Issue. I agree with that submission. Counsel for Dr Wright held out the beguiling prospect that,
              ‘<i>if the Court considers itself able to determine the Identity Issue without having regard to Dr
                Wright’s Reliance Documents, it will not need to trouble itself with the complex and lengthy detail of
                COPA’s forgery allegations</i>.’</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, it would have been a denial of
              my responsibility as the Judge if I were to decline to decide the forgery allegations. Anticipating that,
              Counsel for Dr Wright provided me with their responses to all the forgery allegations, in three parts. The
              original forgery allegations are dealt with in their Appendix 1 to their Closing; the Additional Forgery
              allegations are addressed in section V.B. at [220]-[222] and the Ontier Email allegation in section V.C.
              at [223]-[234]. In what follows I address the submissions in these three sections, which must be combined
              with the detailed submissions from COPA and the Developers.</p>
