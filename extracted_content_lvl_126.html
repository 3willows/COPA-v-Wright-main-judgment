<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Professor Meiklejohn pointed out that it
              would not have been necessary at that time for Dr Wright (if he were Satoshi) to run a setup of the kind
              that he described (69 computers), and in fact he could not have been running such a setup in early 2009 or
              early 2010 as, if he had, it would have increased the difficulty considerably to that which was observed
              at the time see {<b>Meiklejohn1 [74] {G/2/32</b>}}. Mr Gao appeared to quibble with Professor Meiklejohn’s
              evidence in this respect at <b>Annex A [14]</b> to the Joint Statement {Q/3.1/5}, but when faced with the
              source data for Professor Meiklejohn’s evidence at <b>{H/190/2</b>} Mr Gao was unable to sustain that
              criticism {Day18/58:1}-{Day18/59:3}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright responded to that at <b>Wright9 [23]
                {E/26/9}</b> by modifying his evidence to suggest that his machines were not dedicated to Bitcoin mining
              after all and that he was also validating blocks. In cross-examination, he sought to develop that answer
              as follows:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The account in <b>Wright9</b> and in
              cross-examination was significantly different to that presented in his blog, on CoinGeek, in his
              <i>Kleiman</i> evidence and in <b>Wright1</b>. Leaving that aside, there were three elements to Dr
              Wright’s contention that Satoshi Nakamoto was using a setup such as that described by Dr Wright. </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">715.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that the setup was for the majority
                  of the time “<i>validating ECDSA</i>”, which is to say validating the signature of the transactions in
                  each block. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">715.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, that the setup was “<i>running
                    testnet</i>”. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">715.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, that he was running “<i>the Timecoin
                    server</i>”. </p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_716"><span class="judgment-body__number">716.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the first point, the evidence showed there
              were just 219 non-coinbase transactions (i.e. transactions containing ECDSA signatures) in the 32,489
              blocks created up to the end of 2009. Typically, there were zero transactions per block. So the suggestion
              that Dr Wright’s machines were mostly engaged in validating signatures for the transactions in blocks must
              be untrue <b>{Day8/177:11}-{Day8/179:7}</b>, and it was disclaimed by Mr Gao in his cross-examination
              <b>{Day18/60:10-12}</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_717"><span class="judgment-body__number">717.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the second point - Dr Wright running Testnet.
              Testnet did not exist until July 2010 <b>{Day8/175:20-23</b>}. Dr Wright suggested orally that he (as
              Satoshi) was running some previously undisclosed private version of Testnet <b>{Day8/175:25} -
                {Day8/176:1</b>}. That cannot be true. Testnet was an innovation introduced by Gavin Andresen: see
              <b>{L6/290.3/1}</b> in which Satoshi observed to Gavin Andresen on 30 July 2010: “<i>that test network was
                a really good idea of yours</i>”. So his claim that the setup was running Testnet appears highly likely
              to be a lie.</p>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_718"><span class="judgment-body__number">718.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the third point, I agree that Timecoin
              appears to be a recent invention of Dr Wright’s. It was not mentioned at all in the <i>Kleiman</i>
              proceedings. Furthermore, the incident in the re-examination of Mr Jenkins tends to confirm that.
              Moreover, Dr Wright’s evidence as to his electricity consumption is almost certainly untrue for the
              reasons set out in the next section.</p>
