              folders on Overleaf from which he derived the Bitcoin folder. In Shoosmiths’ letter dated 20 February
              2024, they said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><i>“Dr Wright tells us that he cannot remember what those previous project folders were called or
                    whether he copied them directly within Overleaf or copied them from local copies he had previously
                    downloaded from Overleaf. In any event, Dr Wright says that he deleted the previous projects folders
                    after copying their contents into Maths (OLD). As a result, Dr Wright says he no longer has the
                    project folder used for the Overleaf demonstration to this firm earlier on 17 November 2023.”</i>

              Day 15, Dr Wright seemed to regret disclosing the Maths (OLD) folder at all and to pray in aid his deleted
