          fraud are well-established and are summarised by Arnold LJ in <i>Sofer v Swissindependent Trustees
            SA</i> [2020] EWCA Civ 699 at §§23 and 24:</p>

                  specifically alleged and sufficiently particularised, and will not be sufficiently
                  particularised if the facts alleged are consistent with innocence: <span

                  primary facts, provided that those primary facts are themselves pleaded. There must be some fact
                  which tilts the balance and justifies an inference of dishonesty, and this fact must be
                  pleaded: <span style="font-style:normal">Three Rivers</span> at [186] (Lord Millett).</i></p>

                  primary facts which are only consistent with dishonesty. The correct test is whether or not, on

                  innocence or negligence: <span style="font-style:normal">JSC Bank of Moscow v Kekhman</span>

        <blockquote>
          <section>
            <p><i>‘…the forgery allegations are of the utmost seriousness and would, if established, do great
                damage to Dr Wright’s reputation and future endeavours. Although it was confirmed by the Supreme
                Court in <span style="font-style:normal">Re B (Children)</span> [2008] UKHL 35 that there is only
                one civil standard of proof (the balance of probabilities), the courts have maintained that, in
                general, it is legitimate and conventional, and a fair starting point, that fraud and dishonesty
                are inherently improbable, such that cogent evidence is required for their proof; see Males LJ at
                [117] of <span style="font-style:normal">Bank St Petersburg PJSC v Arkhangelsky</span> [2020] 4

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, “pleading is not a game and it is
          about fairness and fairly understanding the case that has to be met, and points about whether a case has
          been adequately pleaded are to be looked at in that context”: see <i>National Bank Trust v Yurov</i>
          [2020] EWHC 100 (Comm) at §249 and the cases there cited.</p>
