<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA’s Additional Forgery Allegations were made
              following the disclosure of, and my permission to Dr Wright to rely on, the Additional Documents. In
              relation to the LaTeX files, Dr Wright’s submissions were set out in section IV of his Written Closing. I
              consider those submissions below. In relation to the remainder (i.e. the BDO drive image and the 17 other
              documents in the Samsung drive alleged to be forgeries), Counsel for Dr Wright relied on the submissions
              made in relation to his original disclosure, and indeed, I took that into account when considering those
              submissions, above.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, it is relevant to note that the BDO
              Drive image was relied upon as a time capsule dating from 31 October 2007. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Nevertheless, Counsel for Dr Wright relied on
              some additional points. First, the alleged hack by Mr Ager-Hanssen prior to his dismissal from nChain,
              which I discuss below. Second, they pointed out that Dr Wright took issue with the evidence of Mr Hinnant
              and Professor Stroustrup relating to <b>{ID_004712} </b>and<b> {ID_004713}</b>. I have considered these
              submissions in the Appendix, see section 33.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So far as the alleged hack by Mr Ager-Hanssen is
              concerned, Counsel for Dr Wright submitted the evidence was as follows, and I quote (although the
              underlining is my added emphasis):</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">‘On 19 October 2023 (before any independent
                  analysis of the Samsung Drive had taken place), Dr Wright stated in <b>Wright 3, para 18</b> that Mr
                  Ager-Hanssen had contacted Dr Wright’s wife on 25 September 2023 and sent her <u>screenshots</u> of Dr
                  Wright’s browsing history, which were later published on social media. Dr Wright believed that Mr
                  Ager-Hanssen had obtained these from his Wright International Investments UK Ltd laptop, by using a
                  policy install attached to software from nChain Ltd to push unauthorised changes to Dr Wright’s
                  system. Dr Wright stated that this was reported to both nChain and the police at the time. Dr Wright
                  understands that Mr Ager-Hanssen was dismissed by nChain shortly after this incident.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 1 December 2023, Dr Wright set out his
                  account of his discovery of the Samsung Drive. At paragraph 22, he explained that after finding the
                  drive at his home on 15 September 2023, he plugged it into his laptop to ensure that it was
                  working{E/20/7}. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 11 December 2023, Dr Wright explained in
                  <b>Wright 7</b> that tweets and photographs subsequently posted by Mr Ager-Hanssen on 5 October 2023
                  revealed that the latter had obtained access to the BDO Drive, because those photographs revealed the
                  contents of the BDO drive being displayed on a laptop that was not his {Wright 7, paras 12-14

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright 14</b>, Dr Wright stated his
                  belief that Mr Ager-Hanssen had access to his company laptops and files from around May 2023 {E/33/5}.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When the Additional Forgery Allegations were
                  put to him in cross-examination, Dr Wright repeatedly denied them and maintained that they must have
                  been caused by whomever had obtained unauthorised access to his systems in 2023 {Day 5/23} to {Day
                  5/121}. <u>He confirmed orally, when asked, that he had left the Samsung Drive connected to his laptop
                    for some time after checking that it worked, and that he did not recall having logged out of it
                    before stepping away from it</u> {Day 5/36}. <u>Notably, COPA has not challenged Dr Wright’s account
                    of his systems having been hacked</u>. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Moreover, Mr Madden accepted in
                  cross-examination that, if a hacker had gained unauthorised access to Dr Wright's computer through,
                  for example, the use of a Trojan, that hacker could have gained full control of that computer,
                  maintained access to it through a remote network connection, and used such access to steal information
                  or spy on Dr Wright. Further, the hacker would have gained and maintained access to other computers on
                  the same network, as well as to any drive that was connected to it. This in turn would have given that
                  person access to the Samsung Drive when it was connected to Dr Wright's computer, and in turn to the
                  BDO Drive {Day 16/84/17} to {Day 16/88/5}.’</p>
