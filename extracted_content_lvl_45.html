<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A large number of the witnesses relied upon by
              COPA and the Developers were not, in the end, required for cross-examination. Furthermore, due to certain
              allegations made by Dr Wright in the course of his cross-examination which related to certain witnesses,
              the parties also agreed terms on which their evidence was accepted, thereby avoiding the need to call them
              to address those allegations.</p>

                  IT law. She authored two papers, “Liability of Internet Service Providers” from 1996 and “Intellectual
                  Property and the Internet: A Comparison of UK and US Law” from 1998. She exhibited a comparison made
                  between her work and Dr Wright’s LLM dissertation which shows the extent of Dr Wright’s plagiarism and
                  copyright infringement of her work<b> {D/490/2}</b>. As was common ground at the hearing of 12 October
                  2023, this evidence is admissible. I consider it in relation to Dr Wright’s credibility.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Professor Daniel Bernstein</u>
<b>{C/4/1}</b> – Professor Bernstein is a cryptographer and professor at the University of Illinois.
                  He is a member of the team that jointly developed the digital signature scheme known as “EdDSA” and he
                  recounts that term being coined in February to April 2011 and first used publicly in July 2011. Dr
                  Wright had put forward a Reliance Document (ID_004009) <b>{L1/115/1}</b> which appeared to be a set of
                  manuscript notes dating from prior to the release of Bitcoin and which contained reference to EdDSA.
                  After receiving Professor Bernstein’s evidence, Dr Wright has claimed that some of the notes
                  (including the reference to EdDSA) were written in or after 2011 (an account which has its own
                  difficulties which I discuss later).</p>

                  Mr Cellan-Jones is a technology journalist who worked as such for the BBC for many years. He was
                  involved in the 2016 signing sessions, which he addressed in his evidence. He was told that Dr Wright
                  could prove he was Satoshi and in reliance on that he transferred bitcoin on 4 May 2016 to the Bitcoin
                  address that Satoshi used for the first transaction, on the understanding that Dr Wright would send it
                  back. To date Mr Cellan-Jones has not received his bitcoin back.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the course of his answers in
                  cross-examination, Dr Wright accused Mr Cellan-Jones and the BBC of being biased and, more
                  importantly, of ‘splicing’ together various answers on film to create, effectively, a false record of
                  the signing session which Dr Wright undertook with Mr Cellan-Jones. It is understandable that Mr
                  Cellan-Jones would feel aggrieved at these allegations and would want the opportunity to address them.
                  Discussions between the parties led to an agreement that in submissions, Counsel for Dr Wright would
                  not rely upon or repeat any of the allegations made in evidence by Dr Wright against Mr Cellan-Jones.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whilst this arrangement was procedurally
                  efficient for this Trial, the effect is capable of being misunderstood. For this reason, I wish to
                  make it clear that I completely reject Dr Wright’s spurious allegations about Mr Cellan-Jones and the
                  BBC and I accept the evidence in Mr Cellan-Jones’ written statement in its entirety.</p>

                  January 2009. Mr Bohm provided evidence of his email communications with Satoshi that had not
                  previously been made public (and to which Dr Wright had never referred). He has also provided a
                  version of the White Paper that he downloaded in January 2009, which Mr Madden authenticated and which
                  has been used in the evidence as a control copy. Mr Bohm sadly died just before the Trial commenced.

                  printed until 22 May 2012. Dr Wright reacted to this evidence in his Chain of Custody schedule by
                  saying that the notes were written in 2011 / 2012. Again, this account has its own difficulties which
                  I discuss further below</p>

                  added to it in 2010, with the default LaTeX template being added in 2017. It cannot therefore have
                  been used in 2006 when it features in documents of Dr Wright (from the BDO Drive) dated to that

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, <u>Professor Bjarne Stroustrup</u>, who
              gave a witness statement in response to certain features of the evidence of Dr Wright. Professor

              not to challenge his evidence.</p>

              Science and the designer of the C++ programming language. In his witness statement, Professor Stroustrup
              explained that he is the designer and original implementer of the C++ programming language and remains
              involved in the standardisation of C++, having received many international honours for his work.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Professor Stroustrup was asked to address a
              particular issue relating to the libraries &lt;chrono&gt;, &lt;thread&gt; and &lt;random&gt; and when they
              were first in use in C++. His evidence was that those libraries were part of C++11 (released in 2011) and
              were unlikely to be in use in 2007-2008, even though these appear in some of Dr Wright’s documents said to
              have been from that period. He said that before C++11, these libraries were called differently: chrono.h,
              thread.h and random.h. Naturally I accept Professor Stroustrup’s evidence in its entirety and I am very
              grateful to him (and all the third party witnesses) for providing it.</p>
