<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Aspose is an online tool that converts PDF files
              to LaTeX. It encodes images using TikZ {<b>Rosendahl1 [196] {G/7/60}</b>}. On an initial review of the
              .tex format images in the White Paper LaTeX Files, Mr Rosendahl suspected that they might have been
              generated from an extant PDF document using Aspose {<b>Rosendahl1 [201] {G/7/61}</b>}, rather than in the
              manner described by Dr Wright. Mr Rosendahl was not able to confirm that point conclusively at the time of
              his first report. The conclusive evidence only emerged when Dr Wright revealed the underlying files from
              his Maths (OLD) and Bitcoin folders.</p>
