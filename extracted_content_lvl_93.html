<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Amongst the documents present on the Maths (OLD)
              folder on the date of its creation (17 November 2023) was a blob file entitled
              “88933455f3f2a39eed5f2f1d6de8ac9167a83778” (the “Aspose blob”) {See the chunks.json file from Maths (OLD)

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Aspose blob was disclosed to the Developers
              on 16 February 2024. The file can be seen at <b>{L21/18.1</b>}. It is an Aspose output of the Bitcoin
              White Paper. It bears the tell-tale signs of such an output: for example, each letter of every word in the
              Bitcoin White Paper is placed individually on the page. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Aspose blob had first been uploaded by Dr
              Wright to the ZZZ folder (over which privilege had been claimed): see <b>{L21/16.1/48</b>}. Dr Wright then
              deleted the file: see <b>{L21/16.1/59}</b>. Unfortunately for him, however, Overleaf had not removed the
              blob when the snapshot of Maths (OLD) was taken.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When cross-examined on Day 5, Dr Wright
              mentioned <i>en passant</i> that he had run Aspose and had a look at the output. When he returned to give
              evidence on Day 15, Dr Wright confirmed that the Aspose blob was “<i>one of the test files I did</i>”. He
              also confirmed that the output of Aspose was so crazily precise that it would be ridiculous to use it to
              reverse engineer the Bitcoin White Paper:</p>
