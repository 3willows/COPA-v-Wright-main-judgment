<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At <b>Wright11 [545] {CSW/1/100}</b> Dr Wright
              complained that many opcodes that were important to the functioning of script had been disabled by BTC. He
              gave the specific example of “OP_2MUL”. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Dr Wuille explained at <b>Wuille2 [12-15]
                {C1/2/3}</b>, the opcodes in question (including OP_2MUL) had indeed been disabled, but they were
              disabled by Satoshi Nakamoto. Thus, Dr Wright was constrained to admit in cross-examination that the
              effect of the changes made by Satoshi was that if one of the disabled opcodes was used in a script, it
              would return a false result – so that any transaction that used it would be invalid <b>{Day8/158:3-9}</b>.

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Faced with this contradiction between
              <b>Wright11 [545]</b> and the evidence of Dr Wuille, Dr Wright suggested that he had “<i>pulled [these
                opcodes] temporarily</i>” <b>{Day8/157:17-18}</b> and that this was a “<i>temporary block</i>”
              <b>{Day8/158:15} </b>and<b> {Day8/158:24}</b>. These suggestions cannot be true: the change had been
              implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto many months before he left the Bitcoin project, but also because OP_2MUL
              had not even been re-enabled in BSV at the time of Dr Wright’s cross-examination

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers invited me to re-read <b>Wright11
                [545-545.e] {CSW/1/101}</b> with the knowledge that it was Satoshi Nakamoto that disabled OP_2MUL. They
              submitted that Dr Wright’s speculation as to why BTC might have disabled OP_2MUL is generally incoherent,
              pointing out that Dr Wright had misunderstood the piece by Gregory Maxwell to which he refers at footnote
              284. In that piece (at slide 22) Mr Maxwell was noting that Bitcoin Script had once been much more
              powerful and noting that this was “<i>not technically hard to fix</i>”.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However the bigger point is that once it is
              understood that Satoshi Nakamoto disabled the opcodes, it is clear that Dr Wright cannot be Satoshi
              Nakamoto. If he were Satoshi Nakamoto, he would not be debating whether there was a possible justification
              for this change. He would be explaining why he made that change.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_736"><span class="judgment-body__number">736.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, Dr Wright’s ignorance of Satoshi
              Nakamoto’s imposition of limits on the size of script and ignorance of Satoshi Nakamoto’s disabling of
              opcodes means that he cannot be Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
