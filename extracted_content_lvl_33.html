                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 10 June 2019 Dr Wright emailed Mr
                                Nguyen
                                referring to a credit card number, describing it as “my old credit card” and attaching
                                some screenshots of
                                supposed banking records <b>{H/78/1}</b>. COPA maintains that the screenshots are
                                forgeries, and I deal
                                with that in section 27 in the Appendix. This point concerns how Dr Wright described the
                                card when asked
                                about it. When Dr Wright was taken to this email, his immediate response was to say that
                                it was in fact a
                                debit card, then adding that the card had been cancelled in 2005 {<b>{Day2/30:10} -
                                        {Day2/31:11}}</b>.</p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He evidently made these points about
                                the card in
                                order to back up his wider story about the email, by saying that the email could not
                                have been putting
                                this card forward as the credit card he had previously claimed in interviews he had used
                                to buy the
                                Bitcoin.org domain.</p>

                                                disclosed an NAB statement for
                                                a “NAB Low Rate Visa” card <b>{L7/390/1}</b>, which makes it very clear
                                                that the card was a credit
                                                card with Available credit of $981 and Credit Limit of $30,000 and
                                                describes it in the small print as
                                                a “NAB Credit Card account”. The statement related to the period August
                                                / September 2008, showing that
                                                the card had not been cancelled in 2005. </p>

                                                evidence, Dr Wright denied
                                                that the card was a credit card and suggested that payments were being
                                                received but it was not to be
                                                used for payments, even though, as can be seen on the face of the
                                                document, payments were also being
                                                made. </p>

                                                was then confronted with
                                                another document from his disclosure; a receipt from a garden centre
                                                <b>{L5/70/38}</b> for a payment
                                                actually made with a card with this number described as an “NAB visa
                                                credit card” in May 2009. He then
                                                pivoted to saying that his wife must have used the card, despite the
                                                bank having told them not to use
                                                it. See <b>{Day2/79:15}</b> to <b>{Day2/82:9}</b>.

                                been cancelled in
                                2005 or that it was not to be used after 2005.</p>
