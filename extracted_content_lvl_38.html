                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is sometimes said that a good lie
                                contains a
                                kernel of truth. In my judgment, on many and frequent occasions, Dr Wright adhered to
                                this proposition. I
                                sensed there was often something in his answer which was true, but the answer as a whole
                                was a plain lie
                                or not an answer to the question put. There are several consequences from his use of
                                this tactic. First,
                                it would either be impossible to pin down every lie and/or it would take weeks to do so.
                                Second, Dr Wright
                                would simply invent further lies in his attempts to cover up existing lies.</p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have reminded myself that just
                                because a
                                witness lies on one point, it does not mean that s/he is lying on other points. However,
                                on the basis of
                                all the evidence, I am unable to place any reliance on what Dr Wright has said unless it
                                is self-evidently
                                correct or is corroborated by some other piece of evidence on which I consider I can
                                place reliance.</p>
