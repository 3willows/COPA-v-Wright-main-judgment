<p><u>Alleged problems with Mr Madden’s reliability as an expert witness</u></p>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_359"><span class="judgment-body__number">359.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for Dr Wright submitted there were two
              main problems with Mr Madden’s reliability as an expert witness which they suggested may have been the
              cause of three fundamental flaws in his analysis.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_360"><span class="judgment-body__number">360.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first main suggested problem was that,
              although acknowledging that Mr Madden has worked as a computer forensic examiner for some years, it is
              suggested that he is not suitably qualified, on the basis it was alleged he had only a single formal
              relevant qualification (as an EnCase Certified Examiner) and no specific formal qualifications relevant to
              Citrix networks, VMware virtual machines or SANs, all of which are said to be particularly relevant.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_361"><span class="judgment-body__number">361.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I reject this suggestion. I very much doubt that
              formal qualifications are an adequate substitute for years of practical experience in forensic analysis,
              which Mr Madden undoubtedly has. So I was entirely satisfied that Mr Madden was suitably qualified to make
              the findings which he did in his various reports. As I said above, I formed the view he was a precise and
              careful witness and one who did not stray outside his area of expertise. Above all, this submission fails
              to recognise that most of Mr Madden’s findings were agreed to by the experts instructed on behalf of Dr
              Wright. As for Dr Wright’s contention that none of the experts were properly qualified (and only he was),
              it is notable that neither he in his evidence nor his Counsel in any submission provided any concrete
              example to substantiate this.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_362"><span class="judgment-body__number">362.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second main problem was said to be more
              important: it was that Mr Madden’s independence was undermined due to the way in which his expert reports
              were prepared. On this point, I have already set out, in paragraph 121 above, the applicable legal
              principles.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_363"><span class="judgment-body__number">363.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Lord Grabiner KC pointed to Mr Madden’s
              explanation of the process (e.g. <b>Madden1</b> at [33]) but submitted that under cross-examination, a
              rather different picture emerged. He drew attention to the following points:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">363.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That there had been at least 6-8 meetings
                  between him and Bird &amp; Bird.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That the drafting assistance appeared to
                  have been extensive: see <b>{Day 16.121/5-22}</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">363.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That he had not adopted the same approach
                  when preparing his expert evidence in other matters.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">363.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That he failed to provide any coherent
                  explanation as to why such an approach was necessary in the present case or why he could not have
                  engaged a suitably qualified and independent assistant.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_364"><span class="judgment-body__number">364.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I think Dr Wright’s submissions on these
              points acknowledged, their validity is closely entwined with the alleged three fundamental flaws in his
              analysis. Before I address these alleged fundamental flaws, I should say something about the allegation
              that there was something inappropriate in the way Mr Madden’s reports were prepared.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_365"><span class="judgment-body__number">365.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Based on my experience in Patent cases
              (conducting and trying them) and in view of the scale of the work required of Mr Madden (particular in
              preparing his enormous first report), I saw nothing at all wrong in the way his reports were prepared.
              Experts in Patent cases often work closely with solicitors, who guide and assist the expert, based on a
              recognition that, without such guidance and assistance, a suitable report would either not get written or
              would take an inordinate amount of effort and time. In particular, having a solicitor prepare a first
              draft of a section is not considered objectionable provided, of course, (a) it is based on matters already
              expressed by the expert (usually in a meeting) and (b) the expert reviews the wording carefully and makes
              any changes necessary so that it properly represents his considered evidence and opinion in the text
              adopted in the report which is served. Depending on the complexity of the technology and the issues, the
              preparation of a long expert report (albeit not as long as <b>Madden1</b>) may well involve more meetings
              than Mr Madden was involved in.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_366"><span class="judgment-body__number">366.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having made those observations, I reserve my
              conclusion until after I have considered the three fundamental flaws alleged by Counsel for Dr Wright.
              These were explained as follows, and I identify them as the ‘unjustified haste’, the ‘content’ and the
              ‘gap’ allegations:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">366.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that on multiple occasions, Mr Madden
                  had concluded with unjustified haste that a document has been dishonestly tampered with or altered,
                  when other explanations were equally plausible from a technical perspective. It was submitted that
                  this was clearly illustrated when he was cross-examined in relation to the following documents in
                  COPA’s list of 20 core forgeries: (a) <b>{ID_004013} </b>Handwritten BDO minutes <b>{L2/159}</b>; (b)
                  <b>{ID_004019}</b> JSTOR Article – Tominaga Nakamoto <b>{L2/245}</b>; and (c) <b>{ID_000073}</b>
                  Statistics assessment homework. The relevant details were said to be set out in Appendix 1. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">366.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, in reaching his conclusions Mr
                  Madden has on several occasions relied heavily on his analysis of the contents of particular
                  documents, and in particular on what he considers to be anomalous or incongruous content. Mr Madden is
                  not an expert (and COPA does not have permission to rely on expert evidence) in any of the multiple
                  academic fields covered by Dr Wright’s disclosed documents. Such evidence is therefore inadmissible.
                  Alternatively, it should be given little weight.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">366.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, and most importantly, Mr Madden seems
                  to have been unwilling to grapple properly with Dr Wright’s complex IT environment, or with how that
                  environment might have caused some of the digital anomalies on which he relied to reach his
                  conclusions. In this respect, Mr Madden’s analysis lacked rigour and was unconvincing.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the first point ‘unjustified haste’, I will
              deal first with the three specific examples cited and then make some more general observations.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_368"><span class="judgment-body__number">368.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to the BDO Minutes
              <b>{ID_004013}</b>, his 10-page analysis of the document is in PM5 <b>{H/31/1-10}</b>. From that analysis
              it is clear that Mr Madden reached his finding of manipulation in relation to this supposedly 2007
              handwritten document after:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are two further points to note:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">369.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Mr Madden clearly stated in paragraph
                  25 of Appendix PM5 various points on which he had not been able to form an opinion.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">369.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, Dr Placks agreed that the BDO
                  Minutes had been manipulated <b>{Q/2/9}.</b> Mr Madden and Dr Placks agreed that their opinion about
                  the authenticity of the document depended on whether Exhibit MS1 was the first ever proof of the
                  notepad. Both experts agreed that there was no reason to doubt the authenticity of exhibit MS1.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_370"><span class="judgment-body__number">370.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second example is the JSTOR article
              <b>{ID_004019},</b> analysed with <b>{ID_003830}</b>, in Appendix PM6, <b>{H/40/1-31}</b>}. Mr Madden only
              made his finding of manipulation after:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">370.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, he had found visible signs of
                  document alteration: misalignment of the key date figures which dated it to 2008.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">370.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, he had found an authentic version
                  online which dated to 2015, which was otherwise identical and in which the figures aligned perfectly.

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, he had exhaustively reviewed over 180
                  JSTOR documents, spot testing a sample (around 10%) of those for authenticity, and established that
                  the footers used at different times had a consistent pattern and showed that the footer shown in
                  <b>{ID_004019}</b> did not date from 2008.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In their Second Joint Statement, Dr Placks
              agreed that <b>{ID_004019}</b> was unreliable but did not go as far as to agree it was manipulated because
              (it seems) he thought the footer style in use in 2008 should be verified with JSTOR.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_373"><span class="judgment-body__number">373.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The third example is Dr Wright’s MSTAT
              assignment <b>{ID_000073}</b>, which Mr Madden analysed in his Appendix PM38 <b>{H/145/1-17</b>}. As I
              found in section 6 of the Appendix, I found Mr Madden’s analysis of this document entirely convincing.
              Furthermore I found no indication that it was done hastily or without due care.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_374"><span class="judgment-body__number">374.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On top of my consideration of these three
              examples, I add my consideration of the entirety of Mr Madden’s work, explained in his six reports. I
              acknowledge that Mr Madden was put under time pressure to prepare his later reports, his Sixth Report in
              particular, and I noticed a slight unease on his part giving evidence about the MYOB Ontier Email
              allegations because there were indications he did not feel entirely on top of all the detail. Having said
              that, I concluded that his unease was not a reflection that his evidence was flawed in any respect, but a
              reflection of the care he wishes to take when presenting his analysis and when answering questions about
              it in the witness box.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_375"><span class="judgment-body__number">375.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, I find the accusation levelled against
              Mr Madden that he reached conclusions with ‘unjustified haste’ to be absurd. I reject the first point.
            </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_376"><span class="judgment-body__number">376.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second point, regarding ‘content’, is, in my
              view, misplaced. Mr Madden did not need to be an expert in ‘<i>any of the multiple academic fields covered
                by Dr Wright’s disclosed documents</i>’. As a forensic document expert, he was and is entitled to rely
              on passages of identical text and/or evidence of text edited away from the apparent original. I saw
              nothing inappropriate in his analysis of text/content.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_377"><span class="judgment-body__number">377.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The third ‘gap’ point was developed further and
              requires further discussion:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">377.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, it was suggested that ‘this gap’ in
                  COPA’s evidence ‘<i>may be the inevitable result of the unorthodox sequence and timing of the expert
                    and factual evidence in this case’</i>. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">377.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, that whatever the reason for ‘this
                  gap’, ‘<i>the fact remains that none of the documents considered by Mr Madden was analysed on the
                    machines or within the environments from which it was collected and no exercise was undertaken by Mr
                    Madden to recreate the relevant IT environment (or parts of it</i>)’.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">377.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, it was said that this matters
                  because, as Mr Madden himself accepted, where the authenticity of documents is in question, it is
                  prudent to analyse not just the documents themselves, but the environments in which they were authored
                  and thereafter stored, as this can throw important light on their forensic analysis {fn: <b>{Day
                    16/11:15} to {Day 16/11:23</b>}}.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">377.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, that this would have assisted, in
                  particular, in the interpretation of timestamps, which Mr Madden agreed is inherently prone to
                  difficulties that are well recognised by digital forensic professionals, such that relying on them to
                  prove that a particular event occurred is not a sound approach. {fn: <b>{Day 16/12:11} to {Day
                    16/13:8}</b>. See, for example, Chow et al, <i>The</i> <i>Rules of Time on the NTFS File System,
                  </i>at <b>{X/50}</b>, in which the authors explain that “<i>Temporal analysis on individual digital
                    file[s] has been adopted since the evolvement of computer forensics. However, it is not evidentially
                    secure to rely on the timestamps of a particular file to prove a particular event occurred at the
                    corresponding MAC times</i>” (p1, LH column), and (at p1, RH column) that “<i>since file timestamps
                    can be altered inherently by batch operations such as automated tools scanning, previewing
                    activities, etc, it is difficult to determine whether a particular file was accessed or opened
                    explicitly by the user</i>.”</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fifth, that Mr Madden accepted that metadata
                  timestamps can be interpreted in different ways, such that, for example: </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">377.5.1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A Creation Date may indicate that a
                      document has been copied, or even “unzipped” from a zip file {accepted by Mr Madden at

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second submission arises out of a point put
              to Mr Madden at the very start of his cross-examination to the effect that he would have been able to
              produce more extensive or decisive conclusions if he had had access to the computing environment on which
              electronic documents were produced (as well as the documents themselves). There are three main points to
              make in response:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">379.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, of course this point was true but the
                  attack was highly hypocritical. From the time he began his work, Mr Madden began asking, through Bird
                  &amp; Bird, for such access. His request was made by letter of 18 May 2023 <b>{M/1/805}</b> at para.
                  11.6 <b>{M/1/810}</b>. This was refused in Travers Smith’s letter of 12 July 2023 <b>{M/1/951} </b>at
                  paras. 23ff<b> {M/1/956}</b>, and that position was maintained thereafter, notwithstanding further
                  mentions of this point in Mr Madden’s reports. The fact remains that it was Dr Wright who could have
                  supplied forensic images but he chose not to do so. It is also relevant to note that when Dr Wright
                  was forced (by my PTR Order) to provide more data (in relation to the LaTeX files), they provided very
                  strong support for the allegations already made. Accordingly, there is no basis at all for Dr Wright
                  to complain that Mr Madden’s work was done without access to the original forensic images which he
                  refused to provide when requested.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, in any event, the point was
                  misplaced because, as Mr Madden had said in his reports and confirmed in re-examination, he only made
                  the findings of inauthenticity which he could safely make on the material he had. It seems likely that
                  access to the computing environments would only have helped him make further findings of anomalies (as
                  his work on the BDO Drive showed).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, in the absence of Dr Wright supplying
                  forensic images, it seems to me to be very clear that, as a practical matter, it would have been
                  impossible for Mr Madden to have recreated Dr Wright’s relevant IT environment. Furthermore, I am
                  certain that any attempt to do so would have been a fool’s errand – Dr Wright would always have been
                  able to point out and would have pointed out some respect in which he asserted (whether truthfully or
                  not) the attempt was deficient.</p>

              expressed in the negative indicating an unusual negative time shift <b>{H/62/21}</b>. Dr Placks agreed the
              ‘two’s complement conversion’ of the edit time <b>{I/6/33}.</b> He also agreed the presence of the
              Grammarly timestamp from 02.06.2016 identified by Mr Madden in <b>PM9, [79]</b> which was 7,127,922
              minutes after the Last Modified Timestamp, an approximately 60-minute difference, which could be accounted
              for by the time which Dr Wright spent making his edits. Both experts agreed the Last Modified timestamp
              had been manipulated.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In practical terms, these data can be explained
              by the fact that the document was created with the computer clock set to 11 November 2002 and saved and
              closed. It is then opened with the clock set to 2 June 2016 and edits are made using Grammarly, but the
              user then realises the wrong clock date is in use, so re-sets the clock back to 11 November 2002. That
              process is responsible for creating the long negative edit time.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">To conclude the points on <b>{ID_000258}</b>,
              the experts agreed the document had been manipulated in their first Joint Statement <b>{Q/2/6}</b> and
              maintained that view in their second Joint Statement <b>{Q/4/6}</b> on the basis that nothing said by Dr
              Wright had caused them to change their minds. As I point out in section 31 of the Appendix, there were
              other clear indicia of forgery, as there were for all the other documents in the Appendix.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Reverting to the submissions made by Counsel for
              Dr Wright, the ultimate end point of them was the submission that I should not conclude that a document
              has been forged simply on the basis that it contains timestamps, fonts and/or versions of software that
              post-date the date on the face of the document.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore, if there had been just one or two
              allegedly forged documents in respect of which these were the only indicia, this case might look very
              different. However, these are not the only indicia, and furthermore, there are a large number of
              allegations of forgery. It seems to me that once my findings of forgery attain a critical mass (as I find
              they have done), those findings provide support for other allegations where there may be fewer indicia.
              The converse is also true: if I had found a number of Dr Wright’s documents did genuinely date from
              2007/2008, his points about his computer environment might well have carried much greater weight. However,
              if I have found that Dr Wright has clearly forged a large number of documents which are said to pre-date
              the release of the Bitcoin White Paper in order to support his claim to be Satoshi, why should I be slow
              to find forgery in relation to other documents which have the same aim and which also share indicia of
              forgery? As I have said, the evaluation of all these allegations is an iterative process.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I can now return to the challenge made to Mr
              Madden’s reliability as an expert witness. This challenge was a bold submission in view of the following:

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Only a tiny proportion of Mr Madden’s very
                  detailed analysis was challenged in cross-examination. Indeed his cross-examination was considerably
                  shorter than the time estimate provided. I have addressed the more general points taken by Dr Wright
                  (above, in the following sections and in the Appendix) and none of them deflect any of the allegations
                  of forgery.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All or very nearly all of Mr Madden’s
                  conclusions were agreed by Dr Placks and Mr Lynch. In other words, there was effectively no expert
                  evidence to contradict Mr Madden’s conclusions.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The only contrary evidence came from Dr
                  Wright and his points have been considered in the Appendix. Dr Wright was unable to deflect any of the
                  allegations of forgery. Furthermore, far from Mr Madden being an unreliable witness, Dr Wright
                  established himself very firmly as a completely unreliable witness.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In conclusion, I reject any suggestion that Mr
              Madden was an unreliable witness. In my view, he plainly adhered to his duties as an expert witness and I
              have full confidence in the evidence he gave. Furthermore (and reverting to the point I discussed in [365]
              above), due to their extensive experience in Patent litigation, I acquit Bird &amp; Bird of any charge
              that Mr Madden’s reports were prepared in an inappropriate manner. So too, Mr Madden. I am very grateful
              to him for all the work he did in this litigation.</p>
