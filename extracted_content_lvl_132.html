<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The CheckBlockHeader function was introduced by
              Dr Wuille in March 2014 as part of a series of header synchronisation changes {<b>Wuille1 [24-25]

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">CheckBlockHeader resulted from a split in the
              functionality present in the CheckBlock function described at [651] to [652] above, so that two of the six
              checks there described (the timestamp and proof-of-work checks) were prioritised ahead of the remaining
              four checks {<b>Wuille1 [25] {C1/1/6}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By modularising CheckBlock into two stages,
              CheckBlockHeader and CheckBlock, nodes could quickly reject invalid blocks based on just their header,
              removing the need to download all of their transaction data. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When he was first taken to the CheckBlockHeader
              function in cross-examination, Dr Wright accepted that these changes were made by Dr Wuille (who had the
              username Sipa on GitHub) in 2013 and were not in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original code

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, one of Dr Wright’s reliance documents
              was a document entitled “<i>BitCoin: SEIR-C propagation models of block and transaction dissemination</i>”
              {L3/237} (“<i>the SEIR-C document</i>”). At <b>Wright11 AppendixB [14.2] {CSW/2/52}</b>, Dr Wright had
              stated that this document had been created between about Oct-Dec 2008 “<i>before I released the system in
                January 2009</i>”. In section 32 of the Appendix, I have found this document to be a forgery.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At <b>{L3/237/13}</b> the SEIR-C document
              purported to provide a description of the Bitcoin system’s block validation process. It stated as follows
              (and note the use of the present tense):</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>“Each node verifies a block before it propagates it to the connected peer nodes. In this way only
                    valid blocks are propagated, and any invalid blocks are quickly isolated. The BitCoin Core client
                    lists all of the validation requirements in the following functions:</i></p>

              reference to a function from 2014 in a document purportedly from 2008) was put to him in

<section>
<p><i> 18 looking at at that time.</i></p>

<p><i> 25 Q. Mr Andresen did not introduce CheckBlockHeader, did he?</i></p>

<section>
<p><i>137: 1 A. No, Mr Andresen got a patch from me initially. So</i></p>

<p><i>138: 1 reference to CheckBlockHeader.</i></p>
