<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright professes to have held multiple
              Overleaf accounts associated with multiple (21) universities since 2020 {See Dr Wright’s ‘cookbook’ at
              <b>{M/2/776}</b> at section 7 (second para) and Shoosmiths’ letter of 4 January 2024 at [3]
              <b>{M/2/802}.</b> However, his relevant account for present purposes is that associated with his

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although Shoosmiths stated that Dr Wright’s
              Overleaf account was created in June/July 2023, the account number incorporates a Unix timestamp in hex
              {64d1faf7} that can easily be converted to a precise date and time of 8 August 2023 at 8:21am. That
              probably explains why Ontier had never heard of it: they had been replaced by Travers Smith on 12 June
              2023 <b>{M/1/881}</b>, two months before Dr Wright created the account.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems (from a letter dated 27 February 2024 –
              after Dr Wright’s cross-examination) that on 5 October 2023 (three days after Shoosmiths’ instruction) a
              former fee earner of Shoosmiths received some form of demonstration from Dr Wright relating to LaTeX. The
              demonstration was so inconsequential that the current fee earners do not recall it. Shoosmiths have not
              subsequently received any documents relating to that demonstration <b>{M/3/48}</b>. Dr Wright performed a
              further demonstration for Shoosmiths in relation to his Overleaf account on 17 November 2023 between
              approximately 12.00-12.30 and 14:00-14.30 {Shoosmiths’ letter of 16 February 2024 <b>{M/3/15} at
                [8.a]</b>}. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That same day, i.e. 17 November 2023, at 16:26
              (after the demonstration to Shoosmiths) Dr Wright created a folder titled “Maths (OLD)” and copied the
              White Paper LaTeX Files into it {Shoosmiths’ letter of 20 February 2024 <b>{M1/2/210}</b>. No earlier
              folders have been disclosed. The main document used by Dr Wright was titled BitcoinSN.tex. He created that
              file at 17:29 on 17 November 2023 <b>{L21/16.1/92}</b> and copied into it the content of a file entitled
              TC8.tex that he had imported into the Maths (OLD) folder when that folder was set up <b>{L21/17.1/2}</b>.
              He appears to have then given another demonstration to Shoosmiths between 17:00 and 17:30 {Shoosmiths’
              letter of 16 February 2024 <b>{M/3/15} at [8.a]</b>}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thereafter, Dr Wright made a series of changes
              to the BitcoinSN.tex file over the course of the next 22 hours, spread over three periods between 17 and
              19 November 2023, as set out below and at <b>{M1/2/157}</b>.</p>
