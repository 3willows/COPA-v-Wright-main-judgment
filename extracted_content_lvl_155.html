<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright claims that, sometime after 4 May
              2016, he destroyed the hard drive(s) containing the private keys used in the signing sessions and that he
              has not had access to them since then. As COPA submitted, he has given inconsistent accounts on this, when
              one would expect him to have retained a clear recollection of such an important event. In his evidence for
              these proceedings, he says he destroyed a single hard drive in around May 2016 at his home in Wimbledon
              and that he threw the hard drive with enough force to shatter the glass platters in the hard drive
              {<b>Wright4 [33]</b> <b>{E/4/15}</b>}. As for his motive, he refers to his ASD and says that a feeling of
              betrayal by Mr MacGregor caused an emotional response in which he acted impulsively {<b>Wright4 [34]</b>
<b>{E/4/16}}</b>. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By contrast, in his evidence in the
              <i>Granath</i> case, he claimed that he had “<i>the first 12 keys and a number of key slices</i>” on two
              drives (a hard drive and a USB stick) and that he destroyed both, one by hitting it with a hammer and one
              by stomping on it with his foot {<b>{O2/11/29}</b>, internal pages 108-110}. He is not only inconsistent
              on the method of destruction. In his <i>Granath</i> evidence, he said that his motive was to “<i>make sure
                that judges and courts understand that Bitcoin is not encrypted and it can be seized, frozen and
                accessed</i>”. He said that he believed that destroying the drives had been the only way to prove this.
              This account of a principled motivation which he still held in September 2022 is very different from the
              account of an action on impulse triggered by a feeling of betrayal by Mr MacGregor. Dr Wright’s attempts
              in his oral evidence in cross-examination to make these two different accounts reconcile were not
              impressive <b>{Day8/79:3} - {Day8/84:25}</b>.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s pleaded stance in this case is that
              he no longer has access to the keys associated with the early blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. In
              <i>Granath</i> (in September 2022), he said that he could probably gain such access: “<i>In theory, I
                could probably track down Uyen [Nguyen] and get other people and do other thing that might give access,
                but I have not even tried to see whether I could do that</i>” {<b>{O2/11/31}</b>, internal page 119}. He
              insisted that he would not do so. If, since September 2022, he has tried and failed to gain access, it is
              surprising that he has not given details in any of his witness statements. The alternative, that he has
              not tried, or has chosen not to access the keys, is simply implausible in view of the pressure which Mr
              Ayre applied in his email of September 2023 <b>{L19/212/6} </b>and in view of what is at stake for him in
              this litigation, both personally and professionally. When he was cross-examined about this, he claimed to
              have discovered in 2019 that he could not access the keys. This conflicted with his evidence in
              <i>Granath</i>, but he then proceeded to deny the conflict <b>{Day8/85:1} - {Day8/87:8}</b>. These, in my
              judgment, were just more convenient (but conflicting) excuses.</p>
