<p><b>OVERALL CONCLUSIONS</b></p>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_918"><span class="judgment-body__number">918.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s case that he is Satoshi clearly
        centred on the numerous documents he disclosed which purported to evidence precursor work to the Bitcoin
        White Paper and source code, along with his own testimony. This is why the status of those documents was
        so important in this Trial.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_919"><span class="judgment-body__number">919.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is important to recognise the scale and scope
        of the documents in question. There are three aspects to this. First, the scope and importance of the
        documents is indicated by those dealt with in the Appendix, particularly those purporting to be precursor
        work or drafts of the Bitcoin White Paper. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_920"><span class="judgment-body__number">920.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second aspect is the number of documents:
      </p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">920.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The reason why <b>Madden1</b> is so long and
            detailed is because he was asked to analyse a very considerable number of documents from Dr Wright’s
            original disclosure. At the hearing in October 2023 when I had to rule on COPA’s application to
            introduce allegations of forgery in addition to the 6 pleaded in the Particulars of Claim, Dr Wright’s
            legal team estimated there was material in <b>Madden1</b> to support allegations that up to 400
            documents had been forged. COPA filed a schedule which indicated they wanted to pursue 180. COPA were
            permitted, by my Order, to plead an additional 50 and did so.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">920.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After that, the Additional Documents were
            introduced into the case at the PTR in December 2023 comprising (a) the 97 documents from the BDO
            Drive and (b) the LaTeX files. This necessitated the existing 56 allegations of forgery being cut back
            to 26, with COPA selecting an additional 20 from the Additional Documents.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">920.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">During Trial, one further allegation of
            forgery (the MYOB Ontier Email) was added.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_921"><span class="judgment-body__number">921.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have dealt with numerous points of detail in
        relation to those 47 forgery allegations, both in the body of this Judgment and in the Appendix. I have
        found all of them proved.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_922"><span class="judgment-body__number">922.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, for the case management reasons I
        explained above, there remained:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">922.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A number of documents which COPA pleaded as
            forgeries in October 2023 (including some of Dr Wright’s Reliance Documents), but those allegations
            were not focussed on at Trial. Notwithstanding that, most if not all of these documents were
            necessarily the subject of cross-examination of Dr Wright because they were an essential part of the
            story.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">922.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A larger number of documents which were
            analysed in <b>Madden1</b> and which Mr Madden found to be inauthentic. These documents could not be
            accommodated within the limits I set for COPA’s pleading of forgeries.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_923"><span class="judgment-body__number">923.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Due to the confidence I have in Mr Madden’s
        evidence and analysis, I accept all of his findings of inauthenticity. In this regard, I note that many of
        the explanations (persistence, XCOPY, virtual machines etc) which Dr Wright put forward in response to the
        allegations of forgery were attempts to explain certain anomalous data identified by Mr Madden in
        <b>Madden1</b> when finding documents to be inauthentic. Dr Wright’s explanations did not begin to meet
        the clear indicia of forgery and it is reasonable to infer that they do not explain Mr Madden’s findings
        of inauthenticity, not least because (acting in accordance with his duty to provide independent objective
        expert evidence) he specifically considered whether there could be alternative explanations and concluded
        not.

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_924"><span class="judgment-body__number">924.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The third aspect is the startling period of time
        over which Dr Wright forged documents:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I noted above, the ATO investigations
            involved him producing two versions of the same supposed email from Mr Kleiman attaching a Tulip Trust
            deed from 2011 and 2014. Mr Madden found a number of Tulip Trust and Tulip Trading Ltd documents to
            bear signs of having been forged in 2014/15{See Appendix PM14 <b>{H/73/1}</b>}.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA’s October Schedule of Forgeries
            included some of those documents, namely: (a) the email from Mr Kleiman attaching the Tulip Trust deed
            <b>{ID_001386}</b>; (b) an Abacus Seychelles invoice which appeared to show ongoing accounting
            services for Tulip Trading Ltd in 2014 but was actually a doctored version of the invoice for purchase
            of that company in late 2014 <b>{ID_001421}</b>; (c) a Declaration of Trust of 21 July 2011 for Tulip
            Trust <b>{ID_001925}</b>; and (d) a company incorporation form for Tulip Trading Ltd which was
            doctored to change the date from 2014 to 2011 and make other changes consistent with the date change
            <b>{ID_001930}</b>. None of those documents made the cut i.e. they were not among the 20 forgeries of
            original documents which COPA pursued at trial.
          </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is clear there is full documentary
            evidence showing that Dr Wright purchased Tulip Trading Ltd as an “<i>aged shelf company</i>” in
            October 2014 from Abacus Seychelles {see for example: the email chains at <b>{L9/188/1}</b> and
            <b>{L9/287/1}</b>; the incorporation form at <b>{L9/183/1}</b>; the purchase invoice at
            <b>{L9/189/1}</b>; and the Commonwealth Bank payment transfer receipt at <b>{L9/191/1}}.</b>
            Meanwhile, a series of documents were produced, each bearing signs of alteration, to suggest that the
            company had been in Dr Wright’s hands since 2011.

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.4.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is also in 2014 that Dr Wright appears to
            have produced his first forged documents supporting his claim to be Satoshi. For instance, the Kleiman
            Email was apparently forwarded by Dr Wright to Ira Kleiman (David Kleiman’s brother) in March 2014.
          </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.5.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Through the documents addressed at trial,
            there are signs of forgery going on over the following years, notably in 2019-20 (when evidence was
            being collected for the <i>Kleiman</i> litigation). For instance, it was in August 2019 that Dr Wright
            produced various documents and posted them on Slack, as discussed in Appendix PM43 <b>{H/219/2}</b>.
          </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.6.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The evidence showed that Dr Wright continued
            producing forged documents in advance of his original disclosure in this action and then throughout
            the remainder of this case, with the experts’ analysis showing that he produced the BDO Drive image by
            adding manipulated files around 17 September 2023 and with metadata indicating work on the Overleaf
            LaTeX files in November / December 2023.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">924.7.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He then produced the forged MYOB Ontier
            Email in the middle of trial.</p>
</div>

</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_925"><span class="judgment-body__number">925.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have reflected on the classes into which these
        documents fall – ‘forged’ and ‘inauthentic’. Although there is an important difference between those
        classes in terms of identifying allegations being made in a pleading, in the unusual circumstances of this
        case and after all the evidence has been heard, the distinction between the two classes seems to me to be
        artificial, particularly when all the evidence points inexorably to the fact that all the documents which
        Mr Madden found to be ‘inauthentic’ were forged by Dr Wright. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_926"><span class="judgment-body__number">926.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Overall, in my judgment, (and whether that
        distinction is maintained or not), Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a
        most serious abuse of this Court’s process. The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway
        in particular. Although whether Dr Wright was Satoshi was not actually in issue in <i>Kleiman</i>, that
        litigation would not have occurred but for his claim to be Satoshi. In all three jurisdictions, it is
        clear that Dr Wright engaged in the deliberate production of false documents to support false claims and
        use the Courts as a vehicle for fraud. Despite acknowledging in this Trial that a few documents were
        inauthentic (generally blamed on others), he steadfastly refused to acknowledge any of the forged
        documents. Instead, he lied repeatedly and extensively in his attempts to deflect the allegations of
        forgery.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_927"><span class="judgment-body__number">927.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Notwithstanding all that, as I was reminded (see
        [343] above) and had well in mind throughout, the issue for decision at this Trial is the Identity Issue.
      </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_928"><span class="judgment-body__number">928.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having (a) reached conclusions on COPA’s
        allegations of forgery, (b) accepted the remaining allegations of inauthenticity which, as far as I am
        aware, cover Dr Wright’s Reliance Documents, (c) not had my attention drawn to any other documents which
        appear to support Dr Wright’s claim and which can be considered reliable, (d) considered the largely
        circumstantial evidence from the witnesses of fact called to support Dr Wright’s case, (e) considered the
        evidence given in Dr Wright’s own witness statements and (f) considered all the evidence adduced by COPA
        and the Developers, the case that Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto is overwhelming.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_929"><span class="judgment-body__number">929.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although, at the conclusion of closing
        submissions at the Trial, I did not and could not have all the detail set out in this Judgment and
        Appendix in my head, I had been taken through it either in pre-reading or during the Trial. I tried to
        identify whether there was <i>any</i> reliable evidence to support Dr Wright’s claim and concluded there
        was <i>none</i>. That was why I concluded the evidence was overwhelming. The preparation of this Judgment
        and Appendix has only confirmed that conclusion.</p>
