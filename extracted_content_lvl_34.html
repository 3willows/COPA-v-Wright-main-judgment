<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These are a series of emails from mid-March to
              early May 2016, the period of the signing sessions and the ‘Big Reveal’ (including the Sartre blog), in
              which Dr Wright was sending and receiving messages using his nCrypt email address {see e.g.<b>
                {L13/67/1}</b>, <b>{L13/78/1}</b> and <b>{L13/123/1}</b>}. As noted above, Dr Wright disclosed these
              emails, reviewed a number of them for the purposes of his statement (as shown by the CPR PD57AC list) and
              nominated one as a Primary Reliance Document which he now says he did not send. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, when confronted with one which he found
              inconvenient from 2 May 2016, he claimed that it was not genuine and that his nCrypt email address had
              been taken over. He went on to claim that subsequent emails from him at that address were not genuine, and
              that emails from his wife at an equivalent address for her were likewise the work of an impostor.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_150"><span class="judgment-body__number">150.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are two significant problems with Dr
              Wright’s account:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">150.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, it is highly implausible that Dr
                  Wright would have disclosed these emails and nominated one as a Primary Reliance Document without
                  mentioning that they were all the work of others pretending to be him and his wife.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">150.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, his account does not make sense on
                  its own terms. It is incredible that the impostor would have been able to go on sending these emails
                  day after day, while the others on the chain were seeing and speaking to each other regularly, without
                  the ruse being discovered. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This was put to Dr Wright, and he gave the
              following incoherent explanation {the full exchange is at <b>{Day8/23:1} - {Day8/26:25}</b>:</p>

<p><i>‘Q. Next question. It would be pretty strange, wouldn't it, for Mr MacGregor to deliver a real
                    message, aimed at you, to an email address that wasn't you? </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>A. No. This is part of what I was explaining before, Mr MacGregor came up with the idea that if
                    he's saying that I'm sending and telling everyone that it's mine, that that's going to be evidence
                    that I'm on board with this and thus I need to follow what he's saying. So, part of the -- the whole
                    thing with Tyche running all of the IT and other systems for nChain was that as soon as I didn't
                    agree, they could cut me off my own email. That was probably one of my stupidest mistakes. By
                    deciding just to be chief science officer, I handed over the control, the CEO or CIO, of all of the
                    IT systems to Robert, and while I wanted just to be the research guy, the problem is, as soon as I
                    did that, other people get to control what I do.</i></p>

                    he? </i></p>

<p><i>A. He came over on those days, yes. I don't recall much of it, but he did. </i></p>

<section>
<p><i>Q. And Mr [MacGregor], you say, was simultaneously sending him fake messages about what you were
                    up to even though he was spending time with you? </i></p>

<section>
<p><i>A. Well, this isn't when Mr Matthews was with me. I'd only just come back from Paris on the 2nd.
                    Next, what Mr Matthews did after that is a different thing. </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>Q. But it was an incredibly high risk strategy, on your account, wasn't it, Dr Wright, for Mr
                    MacGregor to be sending fake emails about what you were up to to somebody who was going to be
                    spending time with you over the following days? </i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>A. No, he didn't actually realise Stefan would. I talked to Stefan and had him come over. I mean,
                    I called him and said, "Please, I need to talk to you", so I don't think Robert actually wanted him
                    to be there, and I know Rob was incredibly angry later. </i></p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, Dr Wright’s story is that, at the time
              when he was in fact taking the position that he would not provide public proof before further steps had
              been taken, Mr MacGregor was sending emails to Mr Matthews and others in Dr Wright’s name taking the
              opposite position (i.e. that he would try straight away to provide public proof in various forms). His
              account is Mr MacGregor was doing this over at least several days in a series of emails while he (Dr
              Wright) was speaking to and spending time with Mr Matthews, all without anyone finding out. I agree with
              COPA that the notion is absurd. Again, I am satisfied that Dr Wright was lying about these nCrypt emails.
