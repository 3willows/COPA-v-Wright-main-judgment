<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am now able to address those aspects of Dr
              Wright’s positive case which do not depend entirely on documents which are alleged to have been forged.
              These aspects were succinctly summarised in section II of the written Closing Submission prepared by his
              Counsel, fully developed in sections III and IV and certain key aspects were developed by Lord Grabiner KC
              in his oral closing submissions. For ease of reference, I have labelled these key aspects A to J. These
              correspond to the parts in section III of Dr Wright’s written closing, albeit not precisely, in two
              respects:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">564.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, I have added additional sections to
                  address points which did not really feature in the summaries in section II, including the writing of
                  the Bitcoin Source Code and the events in 2011 when Dr Wright made his first public comments on
                  Bitcoin. Under each heading I set out in italics the (accurate) summary of the point presented in
                  section II of Dr Wright’s written closing.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, certain matters have relevance under
                  adjacent headings.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_565"><span class="judgment-body__number">565.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I address each of these aspects in turn.
              Although I have given careful consideration to the way these headline aspects were developed in written
              and oral argument on behalf of Dr Wright, and in Dr Wright’s witness statements, it is not necessary for
              me to rehearse or address every point relied on. The principal reason for that is because Dr Wright’s
              lying has been so extensive and pervasive on certain matters it is impossible to discern the dividing line
              between truth and lies, particularly in relation to events prior to the release of the Bitcoin White Paper
              but also certain of the events relied upon after that. I therefore focus on a few points of significance.
              Although I make findings on certain discrete matters in these sections and refer to findings I have made
              elsewhere (particularly as to forgery of documents), in large part I reserve my overall finding to the
              end.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For understandable reasons, in sections II, III
              &amp; IV of their Closing, Counsel for Dr Wright focussed on points which they say support his claim to be
              Satoshi. It should be noted, however, that they did not focus upon and in many cases, did not even
              mention, a whole series of matters which indicate Dr Wright is not Satoshi.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_567"><span class="judgment-body__number">567.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright’s first witness statement was supposed
              to contain his evidence in chief on the Identity Issue. It is therefore not surprising that most of the
              elements A-J feature in that witness statement. </p>

<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘3. Dr Wright has the required skills, knowledge and qualifications to have created the
                        Bitcoin system and authored the White Paper. These qualifications include: (i) his master’s
                        degree in statistics from the University of Newcastle {e.g. {L1/337}} and his LLM from the
                        University of Northumbria {Wright 1 [56]-[60] {E/1/12-13}}; (ii) his numerous other degrees and
                        qualifications including his PhD in Computer Science and Economics and postgraduate degrees
                        spanning many other disciplines, including statistics, game theory, finance, economics and law
                        {Wright 1 [6] {E/1/3}}; and (iii) his cyber security certifications issued by the SANS
                        Institute, including Global Information Assurance Certificates in forensics analysis, reverse
                        engineering malware and the security of .NET code {{L1/327/1}, {L2/128/1} and {L2/282/1}}. This
                        combination of skills and knowledge is consistent with the creation of a system that combines
                        and applies a wide variety of pre-existing technologies and concepts, including cryptography,
                        digital signatures, hash functions, distributed ledgers and game theory.’</i></p>
