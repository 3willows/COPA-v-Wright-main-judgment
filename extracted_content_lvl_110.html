<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In terms of his alleged coding experience, the
              foundation was laid in <b>Wright1 </b>at<b> [25]</b> in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<section>
<p><i>‘My fascination with coding and computing began when I dabbled with C and C++ around the age of
                    eight or nine. By age 11, I had already started writing code for games. I used C and C++ because
                    they were the languages that games were written in. As I discuss below, while I have worked
                    extensively with various coding languages, C++ has remained a cornerstone of my expertise.’</i></p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Professor Stroustrup’s unchallenged evidence was
              that the name C++ was first coined in December 1983, when Dr Wright was 13 years old. When this was put to
              Dr Wright, he did not suggest he had made an error with the dates. Instead, he ‘clarified’ that he had
              been writing in precursor languages. He proceeded to refer to K&amp;R C (K&amp;R being the authors of an
              early version of C), ‘Object C’ (which is how Dr Wright referred to Objective C) and then Solaris C and
              that in 1989 a formal version of C++ and then ANSI C++, a year later, were developed. It was suggested to
              him that all of this was fabricated detail because he had been found out, to which his response was
              ‘<i>what I’m doing is simplifying so that people</i> <i>understand’</i>.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although this is a small point in the great
              scheme of things, it is also revealing because it is an example of what became a very familiar sequence in
              Dr Wright’s evidence:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">571.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright gives an account in his witness
                  statement of something which might appear to be uncontroversial and of minor relevance, but is a
                  foundation or building block of his case that he is Satoshi. It is in fact either wholly or partially
                  fabricated.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA produce evidence challenging Dr
                  Wright’s account.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright prepares his response or excuses,
                  and these he deploys in cross-examination. Only very rarely does he accept he was mistaken. Instead,
                  his response/excuses frequently rely on technical points never mentioned before but explained in some
                  detail, so are difficult to deal with at the time they are deployed and not critical enough to warrant
                  rebuttal evidence or any further questioning.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this instance, it is highly likely that,
              having read Professor Stroustrup’s statement, Dr Wright had researched the precursors to C++ and that his
              detailed account of the development to C++ was true. However, if he really had started with K&amp;R C and
              had Knuth’s book, it is most unlikely that he would have said what he said in <b>[25]</b>. There was no
              reason to ‘simplify’ these matters because anyone could have understood references to various different
              precursor languages. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Later in <b>Wright1</b>, Dr Wright said in
              <b>[71] </b>that ‘…<b>C++ continues to be</b> an integral part of my coding knowledge and skills,
              underscoring its enduring relevance in my professional career’ (emphasis added). He went on to give four
              examples including:</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His extensive employment of C++ at Integyrz,
                  a company he founded and ran from early 2009 to early 2011 which he said specialised in cryptographic
                  code development.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His role as a BDO auditor involved conducing
                  security reviews of code for prominent organisations including banks, necessitating in-depth
                  exploration of various programming languages including C++.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Coding competitively, entering into a C++
                  coding competition with the SANS Institute and coming first, third, fourth and seventh (there being no
                  limit to the number of times he could enter).</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The SANS Institute competition was concerned
              with identifying flaws in certain passages of C++ code set out in various textbooks, and, according to Dr
              Wright, re-writing the sections of code more securely. Again, this is consistent with Dr Wright’s role in
              IT security reviewing malware. It is a somewhat different skill to writing C++ code from scratch. In my
              judgment, the same point applies to Dr Wright’s GSSP-C and GSSP.net certification by GIAC.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In their Closing Submissions, the Developers
              drew together a number of points which cast doubt on Dr Wright’s proficiency in C++, but since all these
              points relate specifically to the Bitcoin Source Code, they are best considered below.</p>
