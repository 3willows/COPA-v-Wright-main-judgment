                  supposed to give his final reply evidence. This was an extremely long statement, comprising 1476
                  paragraphs over 246 pages. It was served on 12 January 2024, along with an application notice by which
                  Shoosmiths sought permission to sign a modified certificate of compliance with PD57AC, which entailed
                  inserting ‘To the best of my ability…’ in two places relating to compliance with PD57AC and PD32,
                  [18.1] &amp; [18.2] and with the Statement of Best Practice. On the first day of trial, I refused
                  Shoosmiths’ application, for reasons in the ruling I gave at the start of the second day of trial. As
                  COPA observed, this application was effectively a concession that PD57AC had not been complied with.
                  COPA then served a lengthy Schedule of Objections on 16 January 2024, to <b>Wright11</b> and its
                  Appendices, citing 7 types of objection to large swathes of these materials. As part of my pre-reading
                  I spent many hours reading <b>Wright11</b> and the objections, many of which appeared to be
                  well-founded. Fortunately I was relieved of the task of ruling on those objections, being told on the
                  first day of trial that the parties had reached a compromise on <b>Wright11</b>, agreeing passages
                  which were to be redacted. In due course, a redacted copy of <b>Wright11</b> was put into the trial
                  bundle. Later, Dr Wright wanted an unredacted copy to be available, although I am not at all sure that
                  any of the passages agreed to be redacted were referred to.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">During these sessions, we generally took a break
              after an hour of cross-examination, although on occasion, the period extended by 20-30 minutes or so to
              the conclusion of the morning or afternoon session. Particularly bearing in mind we were in an extremely
              hot courtroom for the first week of the trial, Dr Wright showed impressive stamina throughout. His wife
              was in court throughout to advise on whether he was showing signs of dysregulation. During his
              cross-examination on Day 15, Dr Wright appeared to me on occasion to be speaking more loudly than
              previously, but that may have been on account of the adjustment of the amplification system in Court on
              that day. However, at no point did there seem to be any sign of dysregulation, nor was any warning to that
              effect given by his wife or legal team. So, in my view, the set of agreed adjustments were adhered to and
              proved effective.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Lord Grabiner KC did intervene numerous times
              during Dr Wright’s cross-examination to warn Mr Hough KC about trespassing on matters which were
              privileged, interventions which also warned Dr Wright. In my judgment, Mr Hough was well aware when his
              question <i>might</i> encroach on privilege and frequently told Dr Wright that he did not want him to go
              into privileged matters. These warnings did not seem to deter Dr Wright. On numerous occasions he sought
              to blame an aspect of a forgery allegation on his previous lawyers. As the Trial progressed, Bird &amp;
              Bird asserted in correspondence that privilege had been waived by Dr Wright over a number of matters, but
              in the result, COPA did not require me to decide their allegations of waiver. Nonetheless, Dr Wright’s own
              legal team evidently concluded that privilege had been waived over certain matters and further disclosure
              and information was provided as a result, which I discuss below.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In some of his interventions, Lord Grabiner KC
              made reference to the fact that Dr Wright was a vulnerable witness. However, I did not get any impression
              that his ASD prevented Dr Wright from understanding the concept of privilege or that his discussions with
              his lawyers were privileged, and no point was made in submissions to that effect. In fact, COPA submitted
              that Dr Wright used privilege as a refuge – referring to something involving his lawyers (at the relevant
              time) as a way of closing off a particular enquiry. This was, as COPA submitted, an abuse of privilege but
              one which demonstrated that Dr Wright understood exactly what he was doing.</p>

            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When giving his evidence orally, it seemed to me
              that Dr Wright was extremely well-prepared. My assessment is that he suffered from no disability in giving
              his evidence due to his ASD (Dr Wright himself made occasional reference to being an ‘Aspie’ i.e. a
              reference to Asperger’s syndrome). COPA had a large number of allegations of forgery and inauthenticity to
              put to him and many of those involved considerable detail. He seemed to be well on top of all the detail.
              He gave crisp answers when asked whether he saw what appeared on the face of a document (‘I do’) and, in
              the vast majority of cases, when it came to the key point, he gave answers which indicated he had already
              considered the point and prepared for it.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright proved to be an extremely slippery
              witness. In many answers he included some slight qualification. He rarely gave a complete answer and this
              was deliberate – he was giving himself an ‘out’ for later. On occasion he was extremely pedantic.
              Initially I was inclined to give him some leeway due to his ASD, but his pedantry was not consistent. He
              was pedantic when it suited him and not when it didn’t. </p>

              connection with the alleged forgeries in the Appendix. However, in their written Closing, COPA drew my
              attention to three specific topics (which are not directly related to any of the allegations of forgery)
              on which they submit that Dr Wright was lying. I address these here, along with two other more general
              allegations.</p>
