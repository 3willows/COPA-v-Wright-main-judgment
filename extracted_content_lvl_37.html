                                documents, Dr Wright included many supposed versions of the Bitcoin White Paper,
                                including a purported
                                precursor draft with the title “Timecoin” <b>{ID_000254}, </b>supposedly dating from
                                2008. In section 24
                                of the Appendix, I have found that document to be forged by Dr Wright. </p>

                                repeatedly sought to use the “Timecoin” moniker in relation to his work developing
                                Bitcoin. Part of the
                                motivation appears to have been to explain away his witnesses’ inability to remember
                                being given a
                                document referencing “Bitcoin”. </p>

                                concerning
                                the Papa Neema emails was that Dr Wright claimed that Mr Mayaka had responded to his
                                request for documents
                                relating to the formation of two Seychelles companies by sending him on 10 September
                                2023: (a) some
                                invoices relating to those companies; and (b) a “Timecoin” paper, “TimeDoc2.pdf”

                                (<b>{ID_006565}</b>), which supposedly dated from April 2009 and presented a development
                                of Bitcoin on
                                behalf of Information Defense (one of Dr Wright’s companies).

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This was remarkable for a number of
                                reasons.
                                First, no reason was ever identified as to why Mr Mayaka (a company formation agent)
                                would have had a copy
                                of the Timecoin paper. Secondly, Dr Wright had not asked for this document or anything
                                like it. Thirdly,
                                by a striking coincidence, this document (which was not in his original disclosure) came
                                to Dr Wright by
                                two means in mid-September 2023; once from “Papa Neema” on 10 September 2023 and a
                                second time through his
                                discovery of the Samsung Drive on 15 September 2023 (which, as Mr Madden found,
                                contained a hash-identical
                                document). Dr Wright had no good explanation for that coincidence {<b>{Day15/57:16}</b>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <b>Wright11 [289]</b>, Dr Wright
                                claimed that
                                he had sent this document to a series of individuals, including Mr Bridges, Mr Jenkins,
                                Mr Matthews and
                                various unnamed others at QSCU (a bank), Centrebet and Hoyts. In a direct contradiction
                                of his evidence in
                                <b>Wright4</b>, he said that he had not sent the original Bitcoin White Paper to Mr
                                Bridges or Mr Jenkins.
                                The only person who gave any support to this account was Mr Jenkins, who said that he
                                had been shown (not
                                sent) a copy of such a document. Mr Jenkins had never mentioned this in his
                                <i>Granath</i> evidence or his
                                witness statement, and it became clear that he had been primed to add the reference to
                                his evidence. I
                                must return to these points in more detail below when I consider a key aspect of Mr
                                Jenkins’ evidence.

                                Neema (and on the Samsung Drive) was light on metadata but contained features that led
                                Mr Madden to doubt
                                its authenticity, including (a) the fact that diagrams had been embedded as low
                                resolution picture images,
                                consistent with having been copied in as screenshots from a public source; and (b)
                                irregular metadata
                                timestamps which were of a date (31 October 2017) associated with the 2023 editing
                                process that created
                                BDOPC.raw {<b>Madden5 [104-126]</b> <b>{G/9/34}</b> and following}. Furthermore, the
                                content of the
                                Timecoin paper is very odd. It has an abstract which is very similar to that of the
                                Bitcoin White Paper,
                                including detailing proof-of-work and outpacing, but the body of the paper then includes
                                a mix of copied
                                and paraphrased sections of the Bitcoin White Paper while missing out the sections on
                                proof-of-work and
                                outpacing. Some incongruous IT security features (including Tripwire) are then bolted on
                                to tie the
                                document to Dr Wright’s areas of expertise {see the cross-examination at
                                <b>{Day15/63:16} -
                                        {Day15/91:8}</b>}. I agree that it bears all the signs of a forgery prepared in
                                haste to suggest Dr
                                Wright was developing the Bitcoin project in early 2009.
