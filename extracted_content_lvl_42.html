<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition to the written and live evidence of
              those witnesses, Dr Wright relied on certain statements by way of CEA Notice. The Witness Statement of Mr
              Jenkin, a partner in Travers Smith LLP, provided further explanation. He set out the reasons why the
              individuals in question could not or should not be called to give oral evidence. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his witness statement, Mr Jenkin did not
              identify particular parts of those transcripts which were relied upon and, indeed, the CEA Notice itself
              makes it clear that the entirety of each transcript was relied upon. Notwithstanding this, very limited
              extracts in each transcript were highlighted, as I understand matters, as being the principal parts relied
              upon. Although I read each transcript, it was clear that the highlighted passages were the only parts of
              any real relevance, and it would have been better if the CEA Notice had been appropriately limited.</p>

              uncle. He served for nearly 30 years in the Royal Australian Air Force, rising to the rank of Wing
              Commander in the Engineering branch and received an award for his work in IT in logistics management. He
              was just verging on age 80 when he gave evidence in deposition for the <i>Kleiman v Wright</i> case in

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Dr Wright’s Opening Skeleton Argument, the
              deposition is described as supplying evidence of Don Lynam’s “<i>knowledge of, and involvement in, early
                work on Bitcoin, including their review of precursors or drafts of the White Paper and running nodes for
                initial testing of the Bitcoin software and code</i>”. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Very little of the deposition of Mr Don Lynam is
              relevant to this Identity Issue which I have to decide. That is largely because Ira Kleiman brought his
              claim on the premise that Dr Wright had been involved in creating the Bitcoin system (as Dr Wright had
              told the Kleiman family in 2014). As a result, nobody in that case had any wish or incentive to test Mr
              Lynam’s statement that he saw a copy of the Bitcoin White Paper. Much of the questioning was directed to
              whether Dave Kleiman was involved in the creation of Bitcoin.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_229"><span class="judgment-body__number">229.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his evidence in chief in his deposition, he
              gave some evidence of the familial influences on Dr Wright as he was growing up. Mr Don Lynam gave an
              account of being close to Dr Wright and regularly discussing his work in the mid-2000s. He spoke of Dr
              Wright’s interests in mathematics, cryptography and internet security, describing him as one of the top
              three in the world in terms of his cryptography qualifications. Mr Don Lynam described Dr Wright’s work
              for Centrebet as security, but for Lasseter’s Casino he said Dr Wright developed what he understood to be
              the world’s first token system enabling global gambling, internet gambling, using all fiat currencies ‘so
              basically doing the same type of thing as Bitcoin’. Mr Don Lynam said he believed the Lasseter’s system
              ‘was the precursor of Bitcoin’.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_230"><span class="judgment-body__number">230.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">He was asked by Dr Wright’s lawyer if he was
              familiar with the Bitcoin White Paper, to which he answered that he had “<i>received the advance and
                pretty rough copy of it in 2008</i>”. He said ‘<i>Craig sent me a copy for my review but it was far too
                technical for me and also was poorly written’</i>. He said it was ‘<i>way above me technically</i>’. He
              didn’t think the draft paper was headed Bitcoin but said it was ‘<i>clearly to be a digital monetary
                system’</i>. He said he had ‘<i>no doubt in his mind that that was the precursor because it had the same
                content as the paper that came out or very similar content</i>.’ He thought it was the natural flow-on
              from some of the work that Dr Wright been doing over the years, the mathematics and the cryptography and
              he had been playing about with other digital currency systems which existed earlier than that and the fact
              that he was working with banks and large accounting systems.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_231"><span class="judgment-body__number">231.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In response to a leading question from Dr
              Wright’s lawyer, he confirmed that he had run a node for Dr Wright after the release of the Bitcoin system
              and that doing so had caused his brand-new computer to become very hot and noisy, adding to his
              electricity bill. When cross-examined by Mr Kleiman’s lawyer, Mr Don Lynam said that he could not remember
              how he had received the paper. He said that he had not attempted to edit it.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_232"><span class="judgment-body__number">232.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The contemporaneous material in disclosure
              paints a different picture. An email in May 2008 provides a family update about Dr Wright’s LLM
              qualification. Another, from December 2008, is titled “<i>Pop’s Service Records</i>” and provides another
              update about Dr Wright’s newest qualifications with a note that “<i>the farm is going well</i>”. Neither
              of these mentions anything relating to Bitcoin at all. The emails do not suggest any relationship of
              regular contact and sharing research, but a distant relationship of occasional updates.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_233"><span class="judgment-body__number">233.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is nothing further until 2019, when Mr Don
              Lynam was being asked to supply an account for the Kleiman case. Mr Lynam wrote to Dr Wright
              <b>{L15/209/2}</b>, making clear that Dr Wright had “<i>advised</i>” Mr Lynam of what the evidence was to
              be: “<i>Memory is a bit foggy of my playing to link as part of the network in the way that you advised”.
              </i>Mr Lynam at that stage was unsure of the year Dr Wright supposedly told him of his invention
              (“<i>since you emailed me in 2007/8/9 about your new currency invention</i>”). </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_234"><span class="judgment-body__number">234.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright responded to the effect that he may be
              able to assist Mr Lynam to trace the coins represented by any early Bitcoin mining. Shortly afterwards, Dr
              Wright’s lawyers evidently suggested the same thing, because Mr Lynam later wrote: “<i>The lady lawyer
                said that they were valuable now as motivation to search” </i><b>{L15/322/3}.</b></p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_235"><span class="judgment-body__number">235.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Following this prompting and the promise of
              value, Mr Lynam appears gradually to have improved his account to prepare for his deposition. By 10
              September 2019, he began describing more detail in an email, offering a narrative to Dr Wright for comment
              (“<i>Is this all some sort of fantasy in my mind or did this really happen?</i> <i>My recollection (or
                dream??) is that you set me up to mine Bitcoin...</i>”) <b>{L15/322/3}</b>. According to what he later
              said in his deposition, he “<i>went back researching” </i>for references to Mr Kleiman on the internet
              {<b>{E/16/32-33} </b>at 33 line 21}; he bought books about Satoshi Nakamoto {<b>{E/16/79} </b>at line 11};
              he discussed his deposition with Dr Wright’s mother and joined Twitter for the first time<i>
</i>specifically to follow what was happening with Dr Wright {<b>E/16/81}</b>. He continued researching
              even up to the week before his deposition <b>{E/16/75} - {E/16/76}</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_236"><span class="judgment-body__number">236.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By the time of his deposition, Mr Don Lynam
              (then aged nearly 80 years) no longer had difficulty recalling the dates and events. And he was no longer
              unsure as to whether the year of Dr Wright discussing his supposed invention was 2007, 2008 or 2009. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_237"><span class="judgment-body__number">237.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Had Mr Lynam been called to give evidence in
              this case, it would have been possible to investigate why his memory worked in reverse, becoming clearer
              as the weeks progressed even though months earlier the details had seemed “<i>foggy</i>”, a
              “<i>dream</i>”, “<i>some sort of fantasy</i>”. As COPA submitted, there is good reason to doubt the
              accuracy of what he had come to believe, having been “<i>advised</i>” by Dr Wright of the facts he was
              required to state, “<i>motivated</i>” to search for what could be “<i>valuable</i>” to him, and pointed by
              Dr Wright’s mother to follow the social media narrative that Dr Wright was posting during that time. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">As for the one point on which Dr Wright really seeks to
                place heavy reliance (i.e. Mr Don Lynam’s supposed sight of a draft of the Bitcoin White Paper), Mr Don
                Lynam and Dr Wright diverge on the detail.  In particular, Dr Wright has insisted at various times that
                his uncle actively edited the draft, as a result of which he (Dr Wright) considered his uncle a central
                contributor to Bitcoin. By contrast, in his </span><i><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Kleiman</span></i><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> deposition, Mr Don Lynam said that it was
                “</span><i><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">way above [him]
                  technically</span></i><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">” and that he had not
                edited it, stressing that he had actively decided </span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"><u>not</u></span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> to edit it </span><b>{E/16/61 </b>and the following
              pages}<span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">. In summary, and with the relevant
                quotations:</span></p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">238.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his deposition in the Kleiman
                  proceedings, Dr Wright said that “Dave helped me edit part of the White Paper, as with other people,
                  including Doug [Don] Lynam, some of my other family...” <b>{L16/267/22 </b>at internal p85, l.12}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By contrast, Mr Don Lynam said that he
                  “<i>did not attempt to edit the paper</i>” and that if someone said that he had edited it, “<i>that
                    would be incorrect</i>” {{<b>E/16/62} </b>at line 21 to <b>{E/16/64} </b>at line 7}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Don Lynam also made clear that he did not
                  have “<i>any technical input into establishing or operating</i>” the Bitcoin system <b>{E/16/64}</b>.
                  This is starkly in contrast to Dr Wright’s contorted story that Mr Don Lynam was “<i>one of the three
                    people behind Bitcoin</i>” <b>{Day6/129:7} - {Day6/132:22}</b>.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_239"><span class="judgment-body__number">239.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is also difficult to reconcile Mr Don Lynam’s
              evidence of being made fully aware of Dr Wright’s digital currency project and the evidence given by his
              son Max Lynam, which (as discussed above) was that he first became aware of the project several years
              later and that he was only aware of the family running an “<i>unknown bit of code</i>” for Dr Wright
              (which he said was not unusual in their family). </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_240"><span class="judgment-body__number">240.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, the detail given by Mr Don Lynam of his
              new computer becoming hot and noisy (and costing more in electricity) as a result of running the Bitcoin
              code is not plausible, given the expert evidence about the early Bitcoin mining. However, it does chime
              with Dr Wright’s false understanding of early Bitcoin mining.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_241"><span class="judgment-body__number">241.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have little doubt that Mr Don Lynam wanted to
              believe the best of his nephew but also that he had been carefully prepared for his evidence in his
              <i>Kleiman</i> deposition. In all the circumstances, I conclude that his account was made up. Accordingly,
              the extracts from his <i>Kleiman </i>deposition carry no weight at all.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The transcript of <u>Mr Gavin Andresen</u>’s
              deposition in the Kleiman case covers some 440 pages (including the indices) with only very few passages
              highlighted. He considered Satoshi to be in the top 10% of all the programmers he had interacted with (he
              put himself in the same category) and believed him to be a brilliant programmer. He had looked at the
              original Bitcoin code (in C++) and gained the impression that a small number of people, possibly one,
              wrote it because it was dense with few comments – i.e. the code did not include much explanation as to
              what the code was doing, unlike in a large programming project where it is necessary to co-ordinate among
              multiple people.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Mr Neville Sinclair</u> worked with Dr Wright
              at BDO from 2006. He was the audit partner in charge of signing off on financial statements. He described
              Dr Wright as a senior manager in the IT division of BDO and worked with a team in that division to support
              the general audit area in relation to IT, security and controls. He described Dr Wright’s technical skills
              as extraordinary, particularly in identifying potential threats for clients but in terms of his personal
              skills, he was very direct which sometimes caused a little bit of friction. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_244"><span class="judgment-body__number">244.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Sinclair said Dr Wright was very keen on how
              clients could better improve their security systems, by better logging of transactions and the holding of
              data. He recalled something drawn by Dr Wright as ‘somewhat similar to what we’d currently look at in
              terms of the description of the blockchain’ but added it wasn’t referred to in that context in that sense.

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Sinclair had further occasional contact with
              Dr Wright after Dr Wright had left BDO at the end of 2008. One contact seems to have been related to
              possible support for unspecified systems which Dr Wright was developing. Somewhat later in 2011, Dr Wright
              told him a bit more about what he was doing with some of our (i.e. BDO) clients, and gave him a circular
              coin with the Bitcoin symbol on it – that was the first time Dr Wright had mentioned Bitcoin to Mr
              Sinclair.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_246"><span class="judgment-body__number">246.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ultimately his evidence was that having seen Dr
              Wright work in IT systems and from a couple of occasions where he was able to ‘oversight’ what he was
              doing, Mr Sinclair said there was ‘a high probability’ that he would be able to do what he was claiming to
              do with Bitcoin and the blockchain technology. Mr Sinclair also spoke of a conference on 23<sup>rd</sup>
              November 2017 on IT security and banking systems. He said the day before an article had been published
              about Dr Wright being involved with Bitcoin and being the author of that system. He said quite a few of
              the people there who knew him were in agreement that most likely he would be the likely candidate to have
              developed the Bitcoin system.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">COPA sought to call Mr Sinclair for
              cross-examination but he is out of the jurisdiction and would not agree to be cross-examined. I agree with
              COPA that his account as recorded in the transcript provides no support to Dr Wright’s claim to be
