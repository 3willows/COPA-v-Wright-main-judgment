<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first occasion on which Dr Wright sought to
              place specific emphasis on the image files was in the evidence in support of the application for an
              adjournment, in which it was said that “<i>it would be particularly difficult to reverse engineer the
                LaTeX code for the images in the Bitcoin White Paper because such code would produce images that did not
                match the exact parameters of the images in the White Paper (for example, as to the precise location and
                angle of lines and arrows).</i>” {<b>Field1 [30] {E/24/10}, </b>confirmed at<b> Wright6 [4]
                {E/21/3}.</b> That point was emphasised at paragraph 57(2) of Dr Wright’s Skeleton Argument for the PTR
              <b>{R/2/20}</b>}. </p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright expanded on that theme in
              <b>Wright11</b>. In a lengthy section of that statement at <b>Wright11 [329-346] {CSW/1/61}</b> he
              purported to provide a detailed account of the technical artistry on display in his LaTeX image files. For
              example:</p>

                    source LaTeX code for the Bitcoin White Paper, including any images created with TikZ or similar
                    tools, is not publicly available on the internet. This means that the precise methods and code used
                    to create the document and its elements have not been shared publicly, nor have they been
                    reverse-engineered. This lack of public availability underscores the unique creation process of the
                    Bitcoin White Paper, where the specific LaTeX coding and formatting techniques used remain exclusive
                    to the original document.</i>” (<b>Wright11 [330] {CSW/1/62}</b>).</p>

                    Paper, the illustration is a result of lines of code compiled from a LaTeX file. This method of
                    image creation, where every line is meticulously drawn using code, exemplifies a technique often

                    explicitly described in the LaTeX file. This method is particularly appealing to those with a
                    background in computer science or development, as it allows for precise control over the image’s
                    composition. Each aspect of the image can be fine-tuned by adjusting the code, offering a high

                    traditional graphic design approaches, where images are created using visual tools and software
                    geared towards graphic artists. These tools often involve direct manipulation of visual elements
                    using a graphical user interface, which is more intuitive for visual design but may lack the
                    precision and programmability of a code-based approach.</i>” (<b>Wright11 [337] {CSW/1/63}</b>).</p>

                    seen in Figure 2 of the Bitcoin White Paper, underscores the flexibility and power of the LaTeX
                    system in handling not just text and formulae but also complex graphical representations. This
                    code-based method of image creation aligns well with the ethos of fields like computer science and
                    development, where control, precision, and the ability to programmatically define elements are

                    for those with a background in computer science and development rather than graphic design. This
                    complexity is evident in the detailed and precise specification of every element within the image,
                    using TikZ (a LaTeX package for creating graphics programmatically).</i>” (<b>Wright11 [339]

                    meticulously defines each aspect of the image, from the rotation and placement of text to the
                    dimensions and positions of shapes. This method requires a deep understanding of LaTeX syntax and
                    the TikZ package, as well as a clear vision of how the code translates into the visual elements of

                    level of proficiency and understanding goes beyond mere familiarity with LaTeX or TikZ; it implies
                    an intimate knowledge of the White Paper’s specific requirements and a deep understanding of its

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Developers strongly suspected that these
              ornate passages of Dr Wright’s statement were made up by ChatGPT. The Developers pressed for Dr Wright’s
              ChatGPT records to be preserved and produced <b>{M1/2/133}</b>. He appears to have held two accounts, one
              of which he supposedly does not have access to and the other of which holds 22 million lines of text
              {Shoosmiths’ letter at <b>{M1/2/149}</b>}. The Developers proposed code to enable Stroz Friedberg to check
              that text for content from Dr Wright’s witness statement {Macfarlanes’ letter at <b>{M1/1/151}</b>}.
              Shoosmiths responded to suggest that they “<i>understood</i>” that those checks had not resulted in any
              findings suggesting the use of ChatGPT {Shoosmiths’ letter at <b>{M1/2/161}</b>}, but declined to respond
              to a request for clarification of what that meant (in particular, whether there had been any hits)
              {Macfarlanes’ letter at <b>{M1/1/16</b>2}}. Thus, contrary to the evidence of Dr Wright

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>When considering the compilation of a
                    LaTeX document into a PDF, it's crucial to understand that this process is inherently
                    one-directional, a characteristic that is rooted in the very nature of how LaTeX interprets and
                    renders its markup language into a document format designed for consumption, such as PDF. In
                    technical terms, the compilation involves parsing the LaTeX source code, which includes all manner
                    of textual content, commands for formatting, and instructions for the inclusion of additional
                    elements, and then rendering this into a fixed layout format that PDF readers can display.</i>”

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>During this compilation, the nuanced and
                    specific instructions contained within the LaTeX source are executed to produce a visually and
                    structurally formatted document. This process involves a considerable amount of calculation and
                    rendering, especially for complex document elements such as vector-based objects, which, in the case
                    of the Bitcoin White Paper, are not separate image files but are instead generated by the LaTeX
                    engine directly within the document as vector arrays. Once these elements are rendered into the PDF,
                    they exist as fixed graphical entities without the underlying LaTeX instructions that generated

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>The transformation from LaTeX to PDF is
                    much like translating a detailed concept into a finished artwork; the final piece does not
                    inherently contain within it the instructions for its creation. Consequently, attempting to reverse
                    this process (reverting a PDF to its original LaTeX source) is akin to an art analyst trying to
                    deduce the precise movements and techniques used by an artist solely from the finished painting.
                    While certain broad strokes may be inferable, the exact method and sequence of creation are lost
