              to documents that have been identified as manipulated or unreliable by Mr Madden and Dr Placks on grounds
              unrelated to the substance of their content. The anachronistic content corroborated those conclusions but,
              as the Developers submitted, also pointed to two more important conclusions.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first is that the forgery of these documents
              must have been by Dr Wright himself. The reason for that is that on Dr Wright’s own account some of the
              anachronistic content to which these documents refer was known only to himself as a result of his supposed
              personal development of Bitcoin and was written by him: (<b>emphasis</b> added)</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second is that each of these documents was
              separately considered by Dr Wright and included in his list of Reliance Documents. The person(s) who was
              Satoshi Nakamoto would not have made the mistake of relying on documents that contained anachronistic
              content to support their claim to that identity.</p>
