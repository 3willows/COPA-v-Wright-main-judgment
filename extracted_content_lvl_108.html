<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I agree there is no particular secret to the way
              in which the Bitcoin White Paper was produced. The metadata of the documents shows that it was produced in
              OpenOffice2.4 (see <b>{G/7/17}</b>). It was not produced in LaTeX.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_560"><span class="judgment-body__number">560.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That was common ground between both parties’
              experts: see <b>{Q/5/1}</b>. It was a conclusion based on sound foundations. Stroz Friedberg were able to
              recreate identical sections of the Bitcoin White Paper using OpenOffice 2.4 {<b>Lynch 1 [120]
                {I/5/35}</b>}. Even leaving aside the “aesthetic” considerations to which reference was made in
              cross-examination <b>{Day17/10-14</b>}, Mr Rosendahl was able to identify five specific features of the
              “innards” of the Bitcoin White Paper PDF which showed that it had been created in OpenOffice2.4 and not in
              LaTeX:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">560.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The fonts included in the Bitcoin White
                  Paper as subsets have names comprised of 16-letter string, followed by the character ‘+’ and the name
                  of the font {see the first column of Figure 2.1 at <b>{G/7/12}</b>}. If the PDF had been generated
                  using a TeX engine, the 6-letter designations would have been chosen randomly {<b>Rosendahl1 [47]
                    {G/7/16}</b>}. In the Bitcoin White Paper, they are chosen in a predictable manner (e.g. BAAAAA,
                  CAAAAA etc) {<b>Rosendahl1 [47] {G/7/16}</b>}. That is consistent with how fonts are labelled when
                  converting to PDF within OpenOffice {<b>Rosendahl1 [48] {G/7/16}</b>}.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All of the fonts included in the Bitcoin
                  White Paper are TrueType fonts. That does not correspond to the output expected of any TeX engine even
                  when TrueType fonts are used by the document. OpenOffice does, however, embed fonts in that way
                  {<b>Rosendahl1 [49-50] {G/7/17}</b>}.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">560.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The page content stream of the Bitcoin White
                  Paper involves individual characters being written into the PDF file one-by-one {<b>Rosendahl1 [52-53]
                    {G/7/18} </b>and Figure 2.5 at<b> {G/7/18}</b>}. That is not consistent with the document being
                  created with pdfTeX, in which words are built from printable characters or glue (i.e. spacing to
                  account for kerning inside words) {<b>Rosendahl1 [53-55] {G/7/19} </b>and Figure 2.6 at<b>
                    {G/7/18}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The trailer of the Bitcoin White Paper
                  contains an element “/DocCheckSum”, which is unique to OpenOffice and is not output by any other PDF

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The header of the Bitcoin White Paper
                  contains binary bytes that correspond to hexadecimal encoding (c3 a4 c3 bc c3 b6 c3 9f) that is only
                  consistent with OpenOffice and software based on it such as <i>libreoffice</i> {<b>Rosendahl1 [62-63]
                    {G/7/22} </b>and Figure 2.12<b> {G/7/23}</b>}. The coding would be different if a TeX engine had
                  been used {<b>Rosendahl1 [64] </b>and Figure 2.11<b> {G/7/23}</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, the Bitcoin White Paper was produced
              by Satoshi Nakamoto in OpenOffice 2.4 and exported as a PDF. In my judgment, Dr Wright’s elaborate attempt
              to carve an alternative narrative by forging documents in LaTeX mark him as a fraud and his claim in these
              proceedings as a fraudulent claim.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The documents produced by Dr Wright on 16
              February 2024 provided irrefutable evidence of his forgery of the White Paper LaTeX Files ahead of their
              disclosure to COPA and the Developers.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For completeness, I return to the convoluted
              submissions made by Counsel for Dr Wright which I set out in [421] above. In light of the above analysis,
              they can be seen as a forlorn attempt to rescue something from the wreckage of the LaTeX files. I have no
              hesitation in rejecting all three submissions. </p>
