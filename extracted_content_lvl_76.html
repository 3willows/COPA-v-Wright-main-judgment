<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Counsel for the Developers submitted, despite
              the fact that Dr Wright had either given evidence or an account of his authorship of the Bitcoin White
              Paper no less than four times, he did not mention LaTeX at all until after the service of <b>Madden1</b>
              on 1 September 2023.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The four (or more) previous occasions on which
              one might have expected Dr Wright to have mentioned that he drafted the Bitcoin White Paper using LaTeX,
              yet no mention of LaTeX was made, are:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">when he was deposed, examined-in-chief and
                  cross-examined in the <i>Kleiman</i> proceedings, notwithstanding that he gave evidence about his

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">in his lengthy Amended Reply in the libel
                  proceedings brought by Dr Wright against Mr McCormack, which directly addressed the question of
                  whether he wrote the Bitcoin White Paper. On this point, reference was made to (i) Dr Wright’s Amended
                  Reply in those proceedings at paragraphs 13 et seq <b>{L16/342/14}</b> and (ii) that Ontier, who
                  represented Dr Wright in the claim, have subsequently confirmed that Dr Wright did not tell them about
                  the so-called White Paper LaTeX Files: <b>{AB-A/5/10}</b>.</p>

                  <i>Granath</i> in Norway on 14 September 2022, which included evidence about the way in which he had
                  supposedly composed the Bitcoin White Paper from handwritten form to the printed page: see

                  <b>{Wright1 [86-99] {E/1/17}} </b>headed “<i>Writing and sharing the White Paper</i>” and purporting

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As far as I am aware, the first mention of LaTeX
              came in Dr Wright’s second Chain of Custody schedule, served on 13 October 2023, followed by a brief
              mention in <b>Wright4</b>, served 23 October 2023, where, at<b> [6.c] {E/4/5}</b>, he said that the
              development of the Bitcoin White Paper involved a “<i>complex workflow utilising various software
                platforms, including LaTeX, OpenOffice and Microsoft Word</i>”. No further detail was provided at that
              point.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These first mentions of LaTeX came after
              <b>Madden1</b>, in which Mr Madden had set out detailed evidence of Dr Wright’s manipulation of the
              metadata of many of the electronic documents on which he primarily relied in support of his claim to be
              Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his Eighteenth Witness Statement for the PTR,
              Mr Sherrell of Bird &amp; Bird exhibited a Tweet on 30 September 2023 from Mr Ager-Hanssen in which he set
              out a screenshot from a report (which he tagged as #faketoshi) which indicated that:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">431.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Under a heading ‘Incriminating content of
                  browsing history’ the report referred to ‘The contents of the browsing history file show that Dr
                  Wright has researched topics relating to backdating files and manipulating metadata’ followed by ‘Here
                  are some examples’.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">431.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first example given is under the next
                  heading ‘LaTeX software’. The screenshot included in the report indicates Dr Wright had accessed an
                  online Q&amp;A on TEX asking ‘<i>Was anything in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin paper compiled in
                    LaTeX</i>?’</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">431.3.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Underneath that screenshot, the report
                  continues with this question: ‘<i>The obvious question is: if Dr Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, why would
                    he ask what software he had used when he wrote the White Paper?</i>’. </p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Counsel for the Developers observed, at best
              this would have been a bizarre question for Satoshi to have asked. Counsel also drew attention to the
              feature of PDF documents compiled from LaTeX code that the PDF file’s internal metadata properties may be
              defined by the document author. He suggested that would have appeared attractive to a person who wanted to
              avoid the metadata pitfalls exposed by <b>Madden1</b>.</p>
