      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Wright first provided a compilation of his
        version of the White Paper on 13 December 2023, a little over 24 hours before the PTR. It was self-evident
        from the content of the compilation {at <b>{L20/248.2}</b>}, when it came, that it was not “<i>materially
          identical</i>” to the Bitcoin White Paper, let alone an “<i>exact replica</i>”. </p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Shoosmiths sought to explain the dissimilarity
        on two footings, which they confirmed would be explained by Dr Wright in his reply witness evidence (see
        <b>{AB/2/68} at [5]</b>), namely:

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The compiled output would “<i>vary according
              to the parameters and process used for compilation” and it was “necessary to use the compilation
              process in fact used by Dr Wright when he published the Bitcoin White Paper as Satoshi Nakamot</i>o”

              Paper was published made a number of minor corrections to the White Paper LaTeX Files to address
              typographical errors in the published form of the Bitcoin White Paper (for example, replacing
              quotation marks to open a quotation in the form (“) with double backticks in the form ('') …</i>”

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The PTR took place on 15 December 2023. At the
        PTR Dr Wright presented the White Paper LaTeX files as containing a form of digital watermark that
        rendered them potentially determinative of the identity issue (see Dr Wright’s skeleton <b>[57-57(1</b>)]
        <b>{R/2/19}</b>), as impossible to reverse engineer (see Dr Wright’s skeleton <b>[57(2)] {R/2/20}</b>) and
        as uniquely coding for the published form of the Bitcoin White Paper (Dr Wright’s skeleton <b>[57(3)]
          {R/2/20}</b>).

                documents which may be relevant to the issues in dispute; and/or (iii) the Overleaf account hosted

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Counsel for the Developers submitted, Dr
        Wright’s account, as to why the White Paper LaTeX Files had not been disclosed previously, fell apart. Dr
        Wright hinted that Ontier might have some motivation for lying about his LaTeX files, but the truth is
        more simple. As explained below, it is highly likely that Dr Wright’s Overleaf account did not exist
        during the period of Ontier’s instruction.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After the PTR, Shoosmiths produced the so-called
        White Paper Latex Files on 20 December 2023, by way of a zip folder entitled ‘Bitcoin (3).zip’
        <b>{AB/2/31}</b>. The ‘Bitcoin’ folder that was disclosed had been received by Shoosmiths on 24 November
        2023 {<b>Shoosmiths’ letter, 10 January 2024</b>}. It was the same folder that had been used to produce
        the compilation that had been disclosed on 13 December 2023 {<b>Shoosmiths’ letters of 29 December 2023 at
          [2] &amp; 4 January 2024 at [2]</b>}. The main document path that had been used to create the
        compilation was a file in the TC subfolder and called main.tex.

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Counsel for the Developers submitted that Dr
        Wright provided only very limited information concerning his Overleaf account(s), and then only
        reluctantly. I agree that he appears to have believed that the Overleaf platform recorded little or no
        metadata or document editing history (see <b>{Day15/148:4-9}</b>). I also agree that, in the period
        between the disclosure of the so-called White Paper LaTeX Files and Dr Wright’s cross-examination about
        them on 23 February 2023, he appears to have made efforts to prevent the production of that information to
        the Developers and COPA. </p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, acting entirely properly, Shoosmiths
        had to disclose certain matters on 16 February 2023, mid-way through the trial. Even after that
        disclosure, it remains the case that we only have a partial view of Dr Wright’s activity in relation to
        the LaTeX files. The data we have relate to a 7-day period between 17 November 2023 (the date of creation
        of a folder entitled “Maths (OLD)”) and 24 November 2023 (the date of export of the White Paper LaTeX
        Files from the ‘Bitcoin’ folder). Counsel for the Developers submitted that even those limited data
        comprehensively destroy any credibility that the so-called White Paper LaTeX Files might otherwise have
        had.</p>

      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This submission is based on the history of Dr
        Wright’s Overleaf account, pieced together as best as one can in light of the fragmentary information Dr
        Wright provided. That is then contrasted with Dr Wright’s efforts to avoid the truth of the account coming
        out. </p>
