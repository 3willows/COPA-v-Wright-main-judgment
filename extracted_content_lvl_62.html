<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is only one key that could have belonged
              only to the creator of the system (Satoshi), which is that associated with the Genesis Block. However, the
              coinbase reward associated with the block cannot be spent, as the Bitcoin Software does not allow that.
              So, while there is a public / private key pair for the Genesis Block, it is not certain that anyone has
              ever known the private key. Whilst early blocks are associated with Satoshi, they could theoretically have
              been mined by other early individuals right after launch. The Bitcoin community, however, does associate
              block 9 with Satoshi, because this block was the one involved in the first transaction from Satoshi to Hal
              Finney.</p>
