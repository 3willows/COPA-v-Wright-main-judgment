        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">My aim has been to assemble the facts into
          chronological order, so far as is possible. However, I consider it is necessary to address the facts
          twice. In the first run through the chronology of events below, I have only set out facts which are
          agreed/generally accepted to be what happened i.e. the first run is designed to set out an
          uncontroversial framework, including various procedural events in this action. </p>

          action. His account is conveniently divided into the following periods of time:</p>

        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It would have been unwieldy if I had addressed
          each allegation of forgery in the course of this second run, so I decided to address them separately.
          That does not mean I have considered them separately from all the other evidence: far from it. Although
          some of the alleged forgeries can be decided simply on what the expert witnesses have said the document
          in question presents, it is true to say that the allegations of forgery are mutually supportive as well.
          So I have dealt with the detail in relation to each allegedly forged document in the Appendix. I
          consider them according to the date or dates ascribed to them by Dr Wright in his evidence and/or by
          reference to dates shown in their metadata. As one might expect, there are a considerable number of
          documents which are said by Dr Wright to predate the publication of the Bitcoin White Paper and/or the
          Bitcoin Source Code. However, there are a number of overarching arguments affecting my consideration of
          those documents which I deal with in the main body of this Judgment.</p>
