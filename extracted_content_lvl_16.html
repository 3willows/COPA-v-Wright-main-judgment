<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At the PTR, Dr Wright applied to rely on the
                ‘Additional Documents’ and to adjourn the Joint Trial, which was then due to commence on 15<sup>th</sup>
                January 2024 with one day of opening submissions followed by 4 days of my pre-reading before commencing
                the evidence the following week.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_78"><span class="judgment-body__number">78.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In their submissions at the PTR, Dr Wright’s
                Counsel placed great emphasis on the importance of the ‘<b>Additional Documents</b>’. For present
                purposes I can deal with two categories of the Additional Documents:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">78.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, Dr Wright had identified 97
                    documents which were a selection of documents taken from two USB drives which Dr Wright said he had
                    discovered in a drawer at his house on 15 September 2023. One of the drives, termed the Samsung USB
                    drive, was said to contain an image of a drive which Dr Wright had used when he worked at BDO from
                    2004-end 2008 – the BDO Drive. This image was said to be a snapshot dating from 31<sup>st</sup>
                    October 2007. The significance of that date was clear – if the image did date from 31<sup>st</sup>
                    October 2007, then 95 of the 97 documents pre-dated either the publication of the Bitcoin White
                    Paper or the release of the Bitcoin Source Code.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">78.2.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second category of documents were
                    certain LaTeX documents stored by Dr Wright in an online Overleaf account.</p>
</div>
</section>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_79"><span class="judgment-body__number">79.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The evidence in support of the application was
                a witness statement of Ms Hannah Field (“<b>Ms Field</b>”), the partner in charge of Dr Wright’s case at
                his (then relatively newly instructed) solicitors, Shoosmiths LLP, but in his sixth witness statement,
                Dr Wright confirmed the content of her witness statement as true. In relation to the two categories of
                Additional Documents, her evidence was as follows:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">79.1.</span></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ms Field reported that Dr Wright had told
                    her that he had not edited or amended any documents in the BDO Drive since 31<sup>st</sup> October
                    2007. She continued: ‘<i>If that is correct, then the 95 documents are at least very strong evidence
                      that Dr Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, as is clear from their nature and contents</i>.’ She set out
                    in Schedule 1 to her statement an explanation of the relevance of these documents based on
                    information provided by Dr Wright which ‘<i>proceeds on the basis that the documents in the BDO
                      Image were not modified since 31 October 2007’</i>. She made one qualification: she referred to a
                    Stroz Friedberg (‘<b>SF</b>’) memorandum and related, as in Wright5, that there were a number of
                    data points identified by SF which required further investigation. Dr Wright accepted these points
                    would need to be analysed by the parties’ forensic experts when considering the provenance of the
                    hard drives.</p>

<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As regards the LaTeX documents, Ms Field
                    related two key pieces of evidence from Dr Wright. In summary, these were that:</p>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">79.2.1.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The relevant LaTeX files were said to
                        be unique, such that (so it was said) mere possession of them is evidence of authorship of the
                        White Paper.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">79.2.2.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is practically infeasible to
                        reverse engineer the LaTeX Code from the published Bitcoin White Paper (for two reasons which
                        she set out).</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">79.2.3.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">And she concluded:</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>‘34. The White Paper LaTeX Files
                          are therefore of the highest possible importance for the trial of the Identity Issue, and that
                          issue cannot fairly be determined unless Dr Wright is entitled to rely on these documents and
                          have his case on the significance of these documents addressed in expert evidence.’</i></p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_80"><span class="judgment-body__number">80.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Notwithstanding the serious criticisms made by
                COPA in their correspondence and evidence served for the PTR <b>{Sherrell18 and Madden3}</b>, I was
                persuaded to admit the Additional Documents. On the evidence of Ms Field and Dr Wright, I could not see
                how a fair trial of the Identity Issue could take place without those documents being considered. </p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_81"><span class="judgment-body__number">81.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The other part of Dr Wright’s application was
                to adjourn the trial to come back in April 2024. Enquiries revealed that it could not come back in April
                2024 and a full adjournment would be likely to lead to the Joint Trial being delayed by about a year. In
                those circumstances, I investigated the possibility of delaying the start of the trial to enable
                analysis of and evidence relating to the Additional Documents to be prepared and filed, and for Dr
                Wright’s reply evidence to be completed. In the result, I ordered the commencement of the Joint Trial to
                be delayed until 5<sup>th</sup> February 2024, with my pre-reading in the preceding week. This put
                pressure on both sides in terms of the additional preparation required, but my expectation that they
                could be ready for that delayed trial date proved to be correct, and I am very grateful for all the hard
                work which was done to enable the Joint Trial to go ahead.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_82"><span class="judgment-body__number">82.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In view of the Additional Documents, I
                considered it right, in my PTR Judgment, to limit COPA’s existing allegations of forgery to the 20
                documents listed in the Schedule appended to Bird &amp; Bird’s Third Letter of 14<sup> </sup>December
                2023. I proposed that COPA should be permitted to add a maximum of 20 further allegations of forgery
                relating to the Additional Documents. These were pleaded in the Claimant’s Schedule of Further Forgeries
                dated 23 January 2024. As I shall relate, there was a yet further Schedule served by the Claimants on 28
                February 2024 of Dr Wright’s Forgery during Trial.</p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_83"><span class="judgment-body__number">83.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my PTR Order, I also ordered Dr Wright to
                provide Mr Madden with a forensic image of the Samsung Drive, containing a forensic image of the BDO
                Drive. The content of these forensic images turned out to be important.</p>
</div>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_84"><span class="judgment-body__number">84.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Following the PTR, the parties exchanged reply
                evidence. They served further reports from experts in forensic documents examination and LaTeX software
                <b>{Madden4 {G/6/1}</b> and <b>Rosendahl1</b> <b>{G/7/1}</b> for COPA; <b>Lynch1</b> <b>{I/5/1}</b> and
                <b>Placks2</b> <b>{I/6/1}</b> for Dr Wright}. The experts produced Joint Statements, reaching near
                complete agreement. </p>

<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_85"><span class="judgment-body__number">85.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On Day 1 of trial (5 February 2024), I
                permitted Dr Wright to rely upon a number of further additional documents which had been referenced in
                and/or deployed with Wright11. As a result, and with the permission of the Court, COPA served a further
                report from Mr Madden – <b>Madden5</b>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_86"><span class="judgment-body__number">86.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">During trial, COPA also served a second report
                of Prof. Meiklejohn answering some points Dr Wright had made in cross-examination relevant to the
                signing sessions, and (in relation to the Overleaf metadata) a further report from Mr Rosendahl. These
                were admitted into evidence by agreement.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_87"><span class="judgment-body__number">87.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 29 February 2024, COPA served on Dr Wright
                the further Schedule of Forgery During Trial as well as <b>Madden6</b> dealing with the forged MYOB
                Ontier Email. The former was agreed as a pleading amendment and deemed annexed to the Particulars of
                Claim, while the latter was admitted into evidence by agreement.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_88"><span class="judgment-body__number">88.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The final point to make regarding the
                procedural history is that no complaint was made that any of the parties were not ready to start the
                Trial on the adjourned date of 5 February 2024.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_89"><span class="judgment-body__number">89.</span>
<div>
<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">To the extent that Dr Wright might be tempted
                to complain about the somewhat unusual procedural history of this claim and the compression of the
                timetable as the start of Trial approached, it may be noted that both those attributes were very largely
                his responsibility, both in terms of his late and very late disclosure and (in line with my findings in
                the Appendix) the very extensive scale of his forgery.</p>
