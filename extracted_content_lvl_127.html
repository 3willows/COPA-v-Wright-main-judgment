<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second problem with Dr Wright’s evidence
              that he was spending AU$11,000 per month on electricity is that it is contradicted by the electricity
              bills that he submitted as part of his 2008-2009 personal tax return. Thus:</p>

              was to contend that Lisarow was “<i>three-phase that was on a separate switch</i>” and billed separately
              to Information Defense Pty Ltd <b>{Day8/174:19-20}</b>. Although there was no documentary evidence either
              to support or contradict this, the Developers submitted it was ‘vanishingly’ unlikely to be true, for the
              following reasons:</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is no documentary evidence that his
                  home in Lisarow was serviced by a three-phase electrical power distribution system. Although that it
                  is not impossible, it was on a residential (not commercial or industrial) price plan

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Dr Wright’s sister confirmed, but Dr
                  Wright denied, at the relevant time the computers in his Lisarow house were set-up in a spare bedroom
                  or living area at the house {<b>DeMorgan1 [11] {E/8/4}</b>}. That being so, it seems highly
                  implausible that it was “<i>on a separate switch</i>”. Mr Bridges referred to the set-up being in Dr
                  Wright’s garage in early 2011: <b>Bridges1 [19] {E/9/6}</b>.</p>

                  registered on 29 January 2009 <b>{L4/446/80}</b>, so cannot have been incurring the electricity
                  consumption costs for the period prior to that date. Yet, the bills for the period prior to the
                  registration of Information Defense are not consistent with AU$11,000 per month being spent on
                  electricity.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In her deposition, Lynn Wright did not refer
                  to any substantial set-up in Lisarow, suggesting that the main computer set-up (comprising just 4-5
                  laptops) was at Bagnoo {<b>{C/27/35} ll. 4-20</b>}.</p>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When taken in combination with the first point
              (which is compelling) I find that Dr Wright was not incurring substantial expense as a result of his
              electricity consumption, and this was a further invention by Dr Wright to try to justify his initial boast
              of running 69 computers. The more pertinent point is that if he were Satoshi Nakamoto he would know that
              such an extensive computer set up with its enormous electricity consumption would not have been required
              anyway: a desktop or two would have mined a lot of bitcoin. Indeed, Mr Bohm’s evidence was that he mined
              100,000 bitcoins {<b>Bohm1 [16] {C/10/5}</b>, but I note that he said at [24] that he had spent all his
              bitcoin} on what was a normal HP Compaq computer <b>{L4/493/1}</b>.</p>
