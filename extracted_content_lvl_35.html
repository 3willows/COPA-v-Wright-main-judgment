              was re-sworn for a further day of cross-examination in relation to matters which had only just been
              revealed prior to his first spell in the witness box. Once again, I was left with a clear impression that
              Dr Wright was not a witness of truth. He lied repeatedly throughout the day. I discuss these further
              below, but, by way of example, I mention the cross-examination on his use of Aspose to create files in
              LaTeX. It is clear that on the Aspose files, he sensed that he was trapped and had no answer. It was at
              that point he reverted to blaming Mr Ager-Hanssen for, it would seem, creating files in LaTeX using
              Aspose.</p>
