                                Dr Wright
                                was re-sworn for a further day of cross-examination in relation to matters which had
                                only just been
                                revealed prior to his first spell in the witness box. Once again, I was left with a
                                clear impression that
                                Dr Wright was not a witness of truth. He lied repeatedly throughout the day. I discuss
                                these further
                                below, but, by way of example, I mention the cross-examination on his use of Aspose to
                                create files in
                                LaTeX. It is clear that on the Aspose files, he sensed that he was trapped and had no
                                answer. It was at
                                that point he reverted to blaming Mr Ager-Hanssen for, it would seem, creating files in
                                LaTeX using
                                Aspose.</p>
