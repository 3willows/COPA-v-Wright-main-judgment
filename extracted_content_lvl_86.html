              evidence of anachronistic metadata, Dr Wright sought to explain the anomaly by reference to his use of a

              used in the White Paper LaTeX Files.</p>

<p><i> 13 on purpose, but when you have a plus one on a time zone,</i></p>

<p><i> 6 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: How? Which bit of this creation date</i></p>

<section>

</section>
<section>
<p><i> 8 A. You still have to put in the time zone information if</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 9 you want it not to change naturally on the system clock,</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 10 my Lord. So the system clock, when it compiles, will</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 11 recognise if it's a plus one and add that and modify it.</i></p>

<section>
<p><i> 12 So, when you do this, unless you do something like</i></p>

</section>
<section>
<p><i> 20 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: And I recall you answered it's manual.</i></p>

<p><i> 21 A. Yes, but what I'm saying here is the difference between</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 22 the negative 7 and the time zone information, my Lord.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 23 They're actually two different settings.</i></p>

<section>
<p><i> 24 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: Yes, I mean, I'm afraid, Dr Wright,</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 25 I simply don't understand that answer. So if you want</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i>171: 1 me to understand it, you're going to have to explain</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 2 precisely how this works.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 3 A. Yes, my Lord.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 4 All right, so what happens is you set a default, and</i></p>

<section>
<p><i> 5 if you put negative 7 and the --</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 6 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: Where do you set the default in LaTeX?</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 7 A. In a command.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 8 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: In this command?</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 9 A. Yes.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 10 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: But I thought you said earlier it's just</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 11 what you type in?</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 12 A. The negative 7, though, is different to the time.</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 13 The time is what you type in. Now, you also either set</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 14 explicitly whether you have time zones changing for</i></p>

<p><i> 24 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: Why would he worry about whether it was</i></p>

<section>
<p><i>172: 1 A. No, it's a time zone negative 7. At the time, I was</i></p>

<section>
<p><i> 2 doing a lot of work with American and Caribbean</i></p>
</section>
<section>

<p><i> 13 MR JUSTICE MELLOR: No, no, no, but if you're talking about</i></p>

</section>
<section>
<p><i> 15 adjusting relative to which time zone?</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 16 A. To the negative 7. So it will take negative 7 and add</i></p>
</section>
<section>
<p><i> 17 one. So when it compiles, it becomes negative 6. So,</i></p>
</section>
<section>

<p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second problem with Dr Wright’s evidence was
              that the supposed pdfcreationdate command to which he referred was not present in the White Paper LaTeX

              Bitcoin project in two stages. On 22 November 2023 at 18:58 he entered a pdfcreationdate of
              20241122010000: see row 746 of <b>{L21/4}</b>. He then changed the date to 22 November 2006: see row 755
