      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have addressed the detail of COPA’s
        allegations of forgery in the Appendix. I have also addressed certain other documents (e.g. the Papa Neema
        emails and their enclosures) in the body of this Judgment. </p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I have related above, at various stages of my
        management of this case, I had to limit the number of forgery allegations which COPA was permitted to
        pursue, to keep the case within manageable proportions and on track. This resulted in all or the vast
        majority of the documents disclosed or relied upon by Dr Wright falling into one of the following
        categories:</p>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">338.1.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, documents in respect of which COPA’s
            allegation of forgery was permitted to be pursued at trial – as just mentioned, I have addressed these
            documents in the Appendix, and certain other documents in the body of this Judgment.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">338.2.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, documents pleaded by COPA to be
            forgeries at an earlier stage, before I placed a further limit on the allegations which COPA could
            pursue, but which could not be pursued at trial.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">338.3.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, documents falling outside the first
            two categories which were examined in Madden1 and which he found to be inauthentic.</p>

      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, documents whose authenticity was not
            challenged by COPA. Most, if not all of these documents are relied on by COPA as establishing the
            relevant sequence of events and are referred to, explicitly or implicitly, in this Judgment.</p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thus, the documents I deal with in the Appendix
        are (i) the original forgeries alleged in the Particulars of Claim (ii) the ‘top 20’ from the first set of
        forgery allegations, plus (iii) a further 20 selected from the ‘Additional Documents’. </p>

    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should briefly mention some of the
        consequences of my case management which gave rise to the documents in the second category. The point is
        that the choices made by COPA when deciding on their original 50 additional allegations of forgery were
        disrupted. I mention two main effects of this:</p>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">340.1.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, it is apparent that allegations of
            forgery were made against a number of related documents which purported to be versions or drafts of
            the Bitcoin White Paper, including three documents labelled ‘Backdated Bitcoin White Paper’ (1), (2)
            &amp; (3), <b>{ID_000536}, {ID_000537}</b> and <b>{ID_000538}</b>, and three coffee-stained copies or
            images <b>{ID_003330}, {ID_004011}</b> and <b>{ID_004010}</b>. Three of those documents had to be
            excised from the list of forgeries that COPA could pursue at trial, even though there was a degree of
            cross-reference between the reasons for the allegations of forgery. I have taken account of this in
            section 30 of the Appendix, as this is the only way to make sense of the allegations made against
            <b>{ID_004011}</b>. In doing so I was satisfied that Dr Wright had every opportunity to make his case
            in response.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"><span
            style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">340.2.</span></span>
        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, it is apparent that COPA was thereby
            prevented from pursuing a number of allegations of forgery which related to the establishment of the
            Tulip Trust and Dr Wright’s acquisition of Tulip Trading Limited, specifically in relation to
            <b>{ID_001421}, {ID_001919}, {ID_001925}</b> and <b>{ID_001930}</b>. I have little doubt that COPA
            were sanguine about those allegations, since they were likely to re-emerge in the claim brought by
            Tulip Trading Limited against the Developers. (As a postscript, whilst preparing this Judgment I have
            learned that that claim has recently been discontinued).

        <div>
          <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A third point to mention is that some of
            these documents were the subject of cross-examination of Dr Wright in any event.</p>

    </div>

  <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_341"><span class="judgment-body__number">341.</span>
    <div>
      <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I was addressed by the Developers on the status
        of a number of documents relating to the establishment and acquisition of Tulip Trading Limited, but I was
        not otherwise addressed on the documents in the second and third categories. As far as I am aware, no such
        document was relied upon by Dr Wright in his Closing Submissions. However, due to my confidence in the
        reliability of the analysis carried out by Mr Madden (most of which was agreed by Dr Placks or Mr Lynch in
        their respective Joint Statements) and in so far as is necessary I make a general finding that none of the
        documents in the second and third categories are authentic.</p>
